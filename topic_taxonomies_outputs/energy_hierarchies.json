              "I thank the chairwoman for her leadership on this bill. The Lower Energy Costs Act is a product of countless hours of discussion between leadership, stakeholders, and our constituents, who are tired of higher costs for less reliable energy. The United States has an incredible energy potential. We have vast resources of oil, natural gas, and other critical minerals essential for energy dominance. Only a few years ago, we were a global leader in both oil and gas production. This was achieved through American innovation, domestic energy production, and investment from the private sector in developing our critical energy infrastructure. Unfortunately, the Biden administration vowed to wage war on American energy. Starting on his very first day in office with the help of the Democrats here in Congress, the Biden administration has pursued radical rush-to-green energy policies that made energy less secure, less reliable, and more expensive for our constituents. This has led to increased costs of energy and goods, hitting the most vulnerable the hardest. We should be about increasing the standard of living for Americans versus diminishing the standard of living that these anti-American energy policies actually do. Energy is the foundation of everything in American life. When the cost of energy goes up, everything else does, as well. H.R. 1 should help America and will help America produce more, deliver more to our communities, and give us the ability to export and help our allies around the world. The American people recognize this, and they are sick of choosing between paying their energy bills and putting food on the table, which is why they gave us the majority, to stop this radical energy agenda. I am proud that my bill, Protecting American Energy Production Act, was included in this package. This provision will protect energy security and affordability by prohibiting the President from imposing a ban on hydraulic fracturing. The discovery of natural gas through the shale revolution has made the United States a leader in energy production as well as emissions reduction and has allowed the United States of America, not our adversaries, to set the price of energy. We are approaching the breaking point in our energy infrastructure. The so-called rush-to-green agenda has prevented the buildout of natural gas and other essential energy infrastructure, which is now reaching capacity. Many States, like my own State of South Carolina, are now at risk of approaching an energy deficit in the next few years if we don't immediately change our current regulatory framework. Fortunately, H.R. 1 addresses these concerns by requiring States to raise legitimate water quality concerns for interstate pipelines and LNG export facilities through FERC's NEPA process instead of weaponizing section 401 of the Clean Water Act to block pipelines. This change is critical to prevent the political agenda of States abusing section 401 to veto projects of national significance while preserving the ability of States to raise legitimate water quality concerns. New England States could finally get gas from the Marcellus shale instead of importing natural gas from Russia, Iran, Venezuela, and a lot of our other adversaries around the globe. We have the resources here not only to meet our domestic demand but also to be a leading exporter globally. Representative DeGette mentioned earlier about capacity and U.S. production and how that would limit available gas for American domestic energy production. The Progressive Policy Institute, which is far from a conservative think tank, put out an article, ``The Climate Case for Expanding U.S. Natural Gas Exports,'' which talks about using that domestically. I would ask you to read it. This package also sets a framework to export our domestic resources so our allies will no longer have to rely on Vladimir Putin's energy oligarchy. The Democrats keep calling this the polluters over people act. That couldn't be further from the truth. The reality is that their energy policies put Russia, China, OPEC+, and radical Green New Deal interests over the interests of the American people. The greatest beneficiaries of their policies are the CCP and Vladimir Putin. Green New Deal policies leave us totally dependent on China for critical minerals that make all of our devices work. Even the green energy devices, wind and solar, need those critical minerals. We have them here. We harvest them cleaner, more environmentally friendly than anywhere in the world. Let's produce them here. That is what H.R. 1 allows us to do. H.R. 1 puts the American people first by unleashing American energy and securing our supply chains. It will increase American energy production and restore American energy leadership in the world. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.",
              "I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for the great job she is doing as chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee to bring forward important bills that will increase America's national security and energy security. There is absolutely no reason that we have to be reliant on foreign countries for our energy. We have actually got the energy here in America. In fact, for those people that are concerned about carbon emissions, for all those carbon footprint warriors that got on their private jets and flew to Davos last week to lecture the rest of the world about not using fossil fuels--they didn't take commercial flights. They had to take their private charters, not with solar panels on the wings of those airplanes, using jet fuel. They lecture the whole world about getting rid of fossil fuels in America, not in other countries. You saw President Biden himself get on Air Force One and fly to Saudi and beg Saudi princes to produce more energy as he is shutting down production in America, limiting leases, limiting pipelines, killing Keystone and other pipelines, limiting the ability to get permits to do basic exploration in America. He is green-lighting pipelines in Russia, green-lighting pipelines and drilling in other places, urging and begging drilling in other places. By the way, if you are concerned about the carbon footprint, no country in the world that produces energy does it better than America. We should want to be doing more in America. As production goes up and goes down based on good or bad policies, as we are seeing today with bad policies, the Nation back in the 1970s said that we are going to have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve--in essence, an American piggy bank to protect our country in case there is some major disruption in world markets, in energy production in America. Maybe there is a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico that limits our ability to produce energy for a brief period of time. That is why we have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is not there to go mask your bad policies. Yet, that is what we have seen from this President. As you can see, this President has raided more than 40 percent of America's strategic reserve; our piggy bank. He has just taken it away. In some cases, he actually sold that oil to China. We came together last week, Republicans and Democrats. The press actually said it was going to be a partisan exercise, so why even waste the time. What they found out is not only did a Republican say it is wrong to raid our piggy bank in America and sell it to China, a majority of Democrats actually agreed with us and sent that bill to the Senate. I urge the Senate to take up that bill that is important to America's national security. But then, today we go even further and say, Mr. Speaker, with this bill, H.R. 21, if you are going to raid our reserves, won't you at least put forward a plan to show how you will replace it. Don't worry. I know the White House gets nervous when you tell them that you have got to produce energy in America. They don't have a problem, again, with foreign countries producing energy. They just don't want it made in America. They use the tagline a lot. You hear it all the time, made in America; except when it comes to making energy, they don't want to make it in America. They make it harder to make it in America. They beg foreign countries to make our energy. This bill says--gives an exemption--except in the case of a severe energy supply interruption. So the President's still got the ability, if there is some actual emergency, to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve the way it was intended in the 1970s. All this bill says is if your bad policy is leading to higher gas prices--and people are getting angry about that, as they should--you can't go and raid it unless you show a plan, as the bill says, the development of a plan to increase oil and gas production under oil and gas leases of Federal lands here. So this would make a lot of sense, except if you are at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In fact, yesterday, the President actually issued a veto threat on this bill. Now, a veto threat should be a rare exercise that you reserve for policy that might hurt the country. Well, let's read why the President issued the veto threat. In his veto threat he said, the administration's use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has been essential to protecting our energy security and to lowering gas prices for Americans. I hope I am not the one that breaks this news to the White House, but Mr. Speaker, your policies have not lowered gas prices for Americans. Maybe the calculator is broken at the White House, but we did the math. Let's do some fact-checking. Since Joe Biden took the oath of office, gas prices have not lowered; they have increased 50 percent. Then the veto threat says, we don't want to do this because our policies have lowered gas prices. Maybe the President, when he realizes that gas prices have gone up 50 percent--they have not lowered for families--he might reverse the veto threat. So we will wait during this debate. Maybe we will get a reversal of this veto threat once he realizes that gas prices have actually gone up, not a little, but a lot, 50 percent increase for a low-income family who is struggling already under the weight of President Biden's spending that has led to inflation and higher prices everywhere you go, the grocery store, supply chain increases. This is crushing middle-class families. It is crushing lower-income families. So what we say is, let's just use our resources. The President actually goes on to say--and this might be the most perplexing part of the President's veto threat; probably explains the most why the President is so misguided on energy policy. He says, because H.R. 21 will jeopardize our energy security and increase gas prices for working families, the administration strongly opposes the bill. So, somehow, some of the energy experts at the White House, again, some of the same people that fly around on private planes to Davos telling you not to use fossil fuels, they think that by increasing American energy production that will somehow raise gas prices. Well, guess what? We have checked the record. These are the same experts whose policies have increased gas prices, not a little, 50 percent. So the White House has been wrong on this issue over and over again, to the point where we had such a strong bipartisan vote last week. Let's put up another strong bipartisan vote and maybe wake the people up at the White House as to what is happening in the real world. When families who are struggling go to fill up their gas tanks, they are not paying less, as the President suggests. Again, the President actually thinks, in his veto threat, that his policies have lowered gas prices. A 50 percent increase is not a lower gas price. It is actually a kick to the gut of those families who are struggling; and we have got to stop having Washington kick them in the gut. So if you look at the moniker right above the Speaker's rostrum, there is a plaque that says, let us develop the natural resources of our land. Why don't we actually do that? Why don't we actually do what has proven to work over and over again? If we open up American energy, it is the cleanest in the world. Don't beg foreign dictators to do it. They don't do it as clean as us, by the way; and it also lowers prices. It also creates good American jobs. Let's actually make it in America again and, if you are going to raid the piggy bank, at minimum, show the country your plan for how you plan to replace it. That is the least this President should do. Let's pass this bill with a strong vote over to the Senate and then get this on the President's desk, and maybe he will reconsider and recognize just what his policies have done to hurt families over these last 2 years. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 21.",
              "I am here today to voice my strong opposition to H.R. 1--because it will not and never could lower energy costs, and it is not taking the long view of where this Nation must go to reach true energy independence. Too often when policy makers talk about energy there are too many sound bites and not enough balanced common-sense approaches to our Nation's energy future. The economy and energy consumption are critically linked to each other because economic activity requires energy consumption. We all know that the booming economy under President Biden has led to energy demand increases and that the war in Ukraine although far from our shores has impacted global energy supply and as a consequence the price of energy. President Biden took decisive action that has led to the sixth consecutive month of reductions in inflation across the entire economy and includes prices at gas pumps. Democrats who took decisive action in the 117th Congress to take control of United States' energy future made major investments in renewable energy that is creating jobs, lowering the cost of energy and putting American consumers first. The oil and gas industries fueled the economic growth and global success of the United States in the last century and without a doubt bolstered the economy that created the largest middle class in our Nation's history. Oil and gas today and into the near future will continue to play an important role in the Nation's strategic and economic interest well into this century. It is important to note that some of the big wins from the Inflation Reduction Law will be the oil and gas industries, which has made significant investments in renewable energy already. It is a simple fact that the owners and operators of the energy delivery infrastructure in the United States--the pipelines, electric power grids, and gasoline distribution hubs that supply energy to an overwhelming majority of homes and businesses in the United States is not going to change anytime soon. The Inflation Reduction Law included multiple oil and gas leasing reforms to reflect today's pursuit of offshore oil and gas exploration while at the same time incentivizing the pursuit of wind and solar by the oil and gas industry. The Inflation Reduction Law will issue in the Energy Age that will bridge the gap between the old and the new forms of energy that will continue to fuel the American economy. This is not nor should it be viewed a war against the old and new forms of energy but a bridge that will allow a smooth transition to the many facets of energy provision that will mean prosperity and jobs, while providing low-cost affordable energy for all people. My greatest concern is that H.R. 1, if it becomes law, would roll back, important reforms by lowering royalty rates, repealing interest fees, and reinstating noncompetitive leasing. H.R. 1 rubber-stamps the construction of new natural gas pipelines-- which is already frighteningly easy--while shutting every agency, apart from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, out of the review process. Natural gas is a viable and important component of energy security for the United States, but its extraction, processing, and delivery to consumers does come with risks. Natural gas in its raw form is odorless and colorless--an odor is added so that people can detect its presence and respond to the threat before it is too late. It is important that safeguards remain in place regarding exploration to protect gas field workers and people who may be in the vicinity of exploration activities. H.R. 1, also poses risks to the United States strategic interest because it removes the requirement that Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exports be determined to be in the public interest before being sent overseas, tearing down guardrails that prevent our adversaries from purchasing more of our energy to use against us. H.R. 1 poses risks to our national parks and public treasures because it would bypass the local and public interest in national lands by allowing oil and gas lease sales even if there is no national interest to support approval of the sale of mineral leases on these lands. The sale of leases on land that is owned by the American people should solely be in the interest of the people of the United States and this can be determined by identifying that there are no nonpublic sources of oil and gas to meet demand. The Nation is on the road toward a smooth transition to other forms of energy to complement its use of oil and gas that will result in a balance of energy options for a more stable, more affordable, and reliable energy supply. The Nation's current mining law is over 150 years old and does need updating, but it should be done so with all stakeholders at the table with a win-win approach. H.R. 1 makes this dangerous status quo worse. H.R. 1 allows mining on public land and the dumping of toxic mining waste as the ``highest and best use'' of those lands, which means the lands will not be suitable for a return to public use without a significant investment by taxpayers to cleanup and restore it to a natural state. I am not saying that all mining or exploration companies will follow the letter of the law--in H.R. 1 should it become law, but if only a few mining leases leave mining waste on public land and are so reckless as to not restore land to its original state the damage would be significant. H.R. 1 would also allow extraction of valuable minerals without paying the owners of the land--the American people in strict violation of every principle of oil and gas leasing. Private property owners who lease for oil and gas exploration expect to be compensated for the lease of their land--the American taxpayer should not expect any less from the lease of their public land held by the Federal government. Letting mining companies continue to extract valuable minerals from public lands without paying anything to the American people is establishing a dangerous precedent for private landowners with minerals, oil, or gas--one that I am sure the people in Texas, Alaska and other high exploration states would take offense over. To date, mining companies--many of which are foreign-owned--have already extracted an estimated $300 billion in minerals from public lands and caused untold damage, without paying a single dime to American taxpayers. H.R. 1 does nothing to improve tribal consultation, even though the vast majority of minerals needed for clean energy are located within 35 miles of tribal lands. The Nation is in the process of transitioning from primary relying on oil and as as a source of energy to alternative sources. The transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy sources will depend heavily on the adoption of critical minerals. Our Nation's clean energy transition will require new minerals, but mining must not come at the cost of our health, our environment, or our special places. I am very committed to--making sure that the emergence and adoption of new energy sources does not leave environmental victims along the way. I am aware of one company, Critical Mineral Refining (CMR) of Houston Texas, that has made environmentally sound extraction, transporting and mining of critical minerals its core mission. CMR's process has been certified by the Environmental Protection Agency as environmentally nuetral technology--which means that there is no harm to the water, soil, or air. Today, as we work to bring new forms of energy to the marketplace and because there are technologies that are cleaner and safer to conduct energy extraction, transportation, and refining these approaches should be adopted as industry standards. The application of this knowledge to critical minerals will prevent sickness, accidents, and deaths due to antiquated approaches to mining and refining being applied to rare earth minerals that are needed in solar and wind energy production. The extraction, transport, and refining of critical minerals could increase sixfold by 2050, according to one scenario by the International Energy Agency. Industries, consumers, and the nation needs to prepare for the boom that is coming from the emergence of critical minerals into the marketplace. By value this market could surpass $400 billion, exceeding the value of all of the coal extracted in 2020. We must reform our outdated mining system to raise the bar for mining both in the U.S. and across the globe in preparation for this new entrant into the energy marketplace. Helping critical minerals emerge and guarding its orderly introduction into our commercial sectors is a major objective of the United States to minimize externalities that often accompany extraction-based enterprises that too often rely upon complex global supply chains. The city of Houston--through Hurricane Harvey's flood waters, Winter Storm Uri's electric grid failures, and other climatic events has experienced the early effects of the climate crisis. Critical infrastructure like the electric grid and water systems must be resilient enough to withstand extreme weather events. This is only the beginning, but it is not too late to get the nation and the economy on the right track to combat the most potent threat to our national economy--climate related weather changes. Climate related weather change cost the U.S. $169.8 billion last year--a $14 billion increase from 2021 and a $55 billion increase from 2020. All the data shows us that the climate crisis is worsening. If Republicans cared about the economy as much as they claim, they would invest in science-based, clean energy solutions. Rolling back of the IRA will have severe consequences, costing the U.S. trillions in economic growth and hundreds of thousands of dollars in jobs. Climate related weather change is the culprit of natural disasters across the U.S. that have killed nearly 3,800 people and caused significant structural damage. In 2022, U.S. wildfires caused by extreme drought and rising temperatures burned a record number of acres and surpassed the 10-year average. Last week, a new UN report found that the world will be unable to limit global wanning by 1.5 degrees Celsius by the early 2030's. The report also found that global average temperatures could warm by 3.2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century causing seven feet of sea level rise by the end do the century. Clean energy, joining the contribution of legacy energy sources, is the future for our workforce sector. Despite fossil fuel production rising by 33 percent since 2014, employment in the fossil fuel industry has declined 34 percent since 2014. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, House Democrats are creating nearly 360,000 jobs by the end of this year and 660,000 jobs by the end of 2025. H.R. 1 masquerades as ``energy security'' when in reality it only sets the stage for actions by less responsible oil and gas energy providers to put at risk communities that may face higher risks for chemical disasters, more toxic air, more unsafe drinking water, and substantially weaker environmental and public health protections. The bill also blocks lawsuits from anyone who did not participate in public comment periods (which are also shortened by the bill). H.R. 1 is drafted so broadly that it exempts all so-called ``critical energy resource'' facilities--such as petroleum refineries that release air toxics like benzene and use hydrofluoric acid linked to catastrophic chemical disasters--from commonsense Clean Air Act and hazardous waste permitting requirements. It also shamelessly grants these facilities amnesty for any violations of federal, state, or local environmental law. H.R. 1 completely erodes the new chemicals review process under the bipartisan Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), allowing new chemicals--even PFAS--on the market without any consideration of safety. Chemicals in the wrong hands can be weapons that are used to wreak havoc in unsuspecting communities, which can pose threats to homeland security. Because of these concerns both Republicans and Democrats joined efforts to pass the bipartisan basis in the 2016 TSCA reform law. The only ``permitting reform'' in H.R. 1 is the gutting of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a bulwark within federal law governing agency regulations of activities that directly impact people to provide meaningful oversight of processes that pose risks to life, health, safety, community welfare and vulnerable persons that include children, the elderly, the disabled and minorities. As industry representatives have already said, this attack on NEPA will not help accelerate the energy projects we need; less than 1 percent of projects even go through NEPA's full, detailed environmental review. One important point to note to people on both sides of the debate-- major oil and gas producers do not hate all regulations--they depend on regulations to keep bad actors and poor command and control processes from putting the environment or communities at risk. Every time there is an accident involving oil, gas, or chemical processes it puts every company and refiner under the spotlight regardless of the work that has been done and continues to be done to get the job right for the environment, workers, and communities. H.R. 1 weakens enforcement of nearly all environmental and public health laws by dramatically limiting the statute of limitations for unlawful permit decisions--like those required by the Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act--to 120 days. Limiting public comment is stopping communities from learning about and communicating their views on government permitting activity--that would like result in actions not in the public interest. Federal regulatory process delays are caused by a lack of agency resources and staff capacity. Fortunately, Democrats already passed more than $1 billion in the IRA for federal agency permitting offices, which will address this issue and is expected to drastically shrink the timelines for permitting. H.R. 1 codifies the reckless, extreme Trump-era NEPA regulations, which were widely opposed by House Democrats, into law. These changes prohibit agencies from properly considering climate change and the cumulative impacts of multiple sources of pollution in permitting decisions, among other bad provisions. H.R. 1 arbitrarily shortens public comment periods for environmental reviews under NEPA and even allows polluters to conduct their own reviews, creating an obvious conflict of interest. It also requires that these reviews ``meet the goals of the [project] applicant,'' instead of the public's interest. Outside of NEPA, H.R. 1 allows the owners and operators of ``critical energy recourse facilities'' to bypass public health and environmental safety standards built into the permitting process, directly endangering the safety of the workers and communities near these facilities. H.R. 1 also undermines Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which empowers states and Tribes to holistically protect their lakes, rivers, streams, and other bodies of water from development. Native people have and continue to be guardian of the land, water, and air whose rights on tribal land must be respected. Energy independence is within our grasp--and so is cleaner, water, air, and soil. We should not treat the environment or people as if they are expendable. To meet this challenge of energy independence, we must stay the course of the Inflation Reduction Law and move ahead in modernizing and increasing the capacity of federal permitting offices, and reform the transmission planning and cost allocation process."

              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, the Save Our Gas Stoves Act. I never would have thought that I would need to introduce legislation to protect Americans' kitchen appliances, but this only goes to show how out of touch this administration's policies have become. In February, the Department of Energy proposed an extreme regulation that would effectively eliminate nearly all gas stoves and gas cooktops on the market today. The Department's proposed rule sets requirements for gas stoves at the maximum technologically feasible, or max-tech level. Based on the Department of Energy's own analysis and DOE's own technology support report, 96 percent of the market share of gas stoves will not, I repeat, not meet DOE's new proposed rule. That is a 96 percent ban. Worse yet, no gas ranges passed DOE's new proposed rule tests. Gas ranges represent nearly 90 percent of all gas stoves sold. What did DOE do after the public heard about this and pushed back? They adjusted their analysis, seemingly out of thin air. Now, they claim that nearly 50 percent of gas stoves will pass their rule. Guess what? That means more than 50 percent won't. Don't tell me they are not trying to ban gas stoves. The DOE is justifying this proposed requirement under the false guise of saving Americans money. However, the estimated savings is just $21.89 over the next 14\\1/2\\ years. That is only $1.50 per year or 12 cents per month. Consumers don't want to give up the features of the stoves they like for 12 cents per month. Consumers don't want to wait an extra 7 minutes to watch a pot of water boil for 12 cents per month. Instead of DOE bragging about how they are going to save consumers 12 cents per month, maybe they should tell the public that natural gas is 3\\1/2\\ times cheaper than electricity and that, according to studies, households that use natural gas for heating, cooking, and drying clothes save an average of $1,068 per year. Consumers don't want the government taking away the features on gas stoves that they like and use. That is not the role of the U.S. Government. That is why I introduced the Save Our Gas Stoves Act to protect Americans' consumer choice. My legislation prohibits the Department of Energy from implementing this extreme rule and prohibits the Department of Energy from imposing standards that result in the unavailability of a product based on the type of fuel the product consumes. Mr. Speaker, I thank the American Association of Homebuilders; the American Restaurant Association; the American Gas Association; the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers; the Arizona Restaurant Association; the American Public Gas Association; the National Propane Gas Association; and several energy companies, including Southwest Gas, which delivers natural gas to consumers in Arizona, for their support of my bill and for their support for American consumer choice. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that this is a bipartisan bill that has received bipartisan support and that my Republican colleagues and 29 of my Democratic colleagues already voted in favor of an amendment to H.R. 1 that did virtually the same thing as this bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my bill. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of consumer choice. I urge my colleagues to vote to save our gas stoves. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1640, the so-called Save Our Gas Stoves Act. This is a Republican messaging bill designed to deliberately mislead the American people about gas stoves. Let's set the record straight with a little reality. The Biden administration is not, and I repeat, not banning gas stoves. This is nothing but a political stunt. House Republicans continue to put politics over people. With this bill today, they are once again putting polluters over people. H.R. 1640 is designed to prevent the Department of Energy from finalizing a recently proposed energy efficiency standard for electric and gas stoves and cooktops that would lower energy bills, improve Americans' health, and cut pollution. DOE energy efficiency standards are extremely popular. A recent poll found that three out of five Americans support stricter energy efficiency standards for appliances and buildings. The proposed DOE rule that Republicans are trying to prevent from moving forward is a commonsense standard. The claim that 96 percent of gas stoves on the market don't meet the proposed DOE standard is just not true. Mr. Speaker, 50 percent of the market already meets the proposed standard, including all entry-level models. More importantly, the proposed standard only applies to new gas stoves manufactured and sold 3 years after the rule is finalized. That would give manufacturers more than enough time to meet these new standards. There is simply no reason for this proposed rule to be controversial. No one is saying you can't keep your gas stove. No one is saying you don't have a choice. No one is saying you have to move to electric stoves. This is all misinformation. Rather than acknowledging the facts, Republicans are instead employing their usual scare tactics, putting politics over people. Despite what you hear from my Republican colleagues today, the DOE rule does not ban gas stoves, does not remove gas stoves from homes, and does not prevent anyone from putting a gas stove in their home. This rule only applies to new stoves, and, as I said, manufacturers have 3 years to meet the standard. Mr. Speaker, I am sorry I have to keep repeating it, but I know the other side keeps repeating the misinformation. All this means is that if a consumer goes to buy a new gas stove in 3 years, it will be more energy efficient and cheaper to operate. That is a win for consumers, our health, and our ongoing fight to combat the worsening climate crisis. Mr. Speaker, to make it worse, Republicans are not just going after this energy efficiency standard. Since the bill does not include a sunset clause, it could forever limit the Department of Energy from taking substantive action to improve energy efficiency of cooktops. This is just another way Republicans are continuing to prop up their polluter friends. This bill as well as the REINS Act, which is on the floor later this evening, show that Republicans are skeptical of everything agencies do, including all rulemakings and regulations. Republicans think that they can do the math, conduct the analysis, and reach conclusions better than the subject matter experts at our Federal agencies. That is not how our government works. We hire agency experts to make the best decisions and do their jobs best. The Department of Energy rulemaking process is detailed and well researched, with ample opportunity for public engagement. Commonsense energy efficiency standards save everyday Americans money and reduce emissions. These standards are popular, and cooktops that meet the standard are already available on the market. Republicans claim to care about energy prices, but this Republican bill prohibits the Department of Energy from finalizing a rule that can save consumers up to $1.7 billion. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1640 should be rejected so that the Department of Energy can proceed with its commonsense energy efficiency standards. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I can't even believe we are at this moment where the administration wants to take your gas stove--not take your gas stove but limit what you can purchase in the future. I rise in support of H.R. 1640, the Save Our Gas Stoves Act. It is no secret this administration has waged war on American energy. From day one, President Biden has waged war on American energy, doing everything possible to phase out the use of all fossil fuels, including American-produced oil and clean-burning, American-produced natural gas. Now, they are taking it a step further. They are dictating what appliances Americans can purchase for their homes. In February, the Department of Energy announced a new proposal that would ban most natural-gas-fueled stoves on the market today. According to DOE's evaluation, only 4 percent of the gas stove cooking tops tested would meet DOE's proposed standard. DOE's proposed regulation would render gas stoves almost completely unavailable to the American consumer. The average annual savings under the proposed rule would be only about $1 over the average lifetime of the appliance--$1 a year. We are debating a proposed rule that would save Americans, on average, $1 a year over the life of the appliance? Mr. Speaker, we have a lot more to do in this United States Congress than debating a proposed rule that will limit Americans' choices for appliances that would only save them $1 a year. This clearly does not achieve the significant savings of energy as the law, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, requires. So, what is this all about? I will tell you what it is about, Mr. Speaker. The Democrats and this administration hate fossil fuels, and they want to diminish Americans' standard of living. This rule is illegal, and it should be withdrawn. It is not a sincere effort to improve efficiency but rather a part of the whole-of- government approach to target energy sources they ideologically oppose. H.R. 1640, the Save Our Gas Stoves Act, which we are debating today, would prohibit the Secretary of Energy from finalizing, implementing, or enforcing the recently proposed rule. It would also prohibit the Department of Energy from reissuing a rule that bans the use of natural gas. Their goal is to end natural gas in this country. Natural gas is what got us down to the carbon emissions levels that we have achieved. If you want to approach it from the climate change standpoint, the carbon emissions standpoint has been because of natural gas. It would also prohibit the Department of Energy from reissuing a rule. It would clarify that DOE does not have the authority to remove cooking products from the market simply because of the fuel product that the appliance consumes. I am a proud cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation, and I thank Congresswoman Lesko for her leadership on this and for introducing this bill. Americans should be free to choose the cooking products they use in their homes and their businesses, and this bill ensures that. Households that use natural gas for heating, cooking, and clothes drying save an average of $1,068 per year compared to homes that use electricity for those appliances. The rush to green and mass electrification efforts pursued by the Biden administration are costing Americans and making everyday life more expensive, all for $1 per year savings. It is gas stoves today. It will be gas furnaces tomorrow. They are already talking about gas hot water heaters and then dryers. They are coming after your natural gas appliances because they hate natural gas. The bottom line is that, on day one, President Biden said that we are going to end the use of fossil fuels. He wanted to ban fracking, offshore production, and onshore production. That is the real reason we are debating this. It is not about the appliance. It is about the war on energy and American-produced energy. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that is in front of us today which prioritizes American energy affordability and reliability and that puts the American people first and gives them choices. Let the market determine which choice they can have, and let the consumer choose which one best meets their needs for their family, for their households, and for their businesses as they look at the bottom line in their budgets because the intention of the proposed rule only saves American families $1 a year. Give me a break. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1640."

              "I rise in support of the amendment introduced by my friend and colleague, the gentlelady from Virginia. Virginia is blessed with beautiful coastlines. The Atlantic Coast and Chesapeake Bay provide critical habitat to marine life and offer numerous recreational opportunities to locals and tourists. Virginia's coasts are also home to a growing source of clean, affordable, and domestic energy thanks to ideal windspeeds, shallow waters, shipping lanes free of overhead obstruction, and a talented workforce. Located 27 miles off the coast, the first two turbines in federal waters are not visible from shore. The benefits they generate, however, are increasingly being felt on shore as emissions are lowered and good, family-sustaining jobs are created. These exciting developments are in sharp contrast to what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have planned for our coastal communities--an expansion of offshore drilling. We ought to learn from the tragic mistakes of our past: Exxon Valdez in the Prince William Sound, Santa Barbara off the coast of Southern California, and Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico. Throughout my career, I have opposed attempts to open Virginia's coastline to offshore drilling along with local communities, small businesses, scientists, beachgoers, environmentalists, seafood lovers, and people of faith. The Virginia Beach Restaurant Association, the Virginia Beach Hotel Association, and the Virginia Restaurant, Lodging and Travel Association all oppose offshore drilling along with Oceana, the Sierra Club, Chesapeake Climate Action Network, Surfrider Foundation, Virginia Interfaith Power & Light and so many others. National security experts also warn that offshore drilling is incompatible with military training in the region, not to mention the incredible harm a spill would do to military facilities. As sea levels in Norfolk and around the world continue to rise, any expansion of highly polluting fossil fuel infrastructure is simply a bad idea. Virginians are simply not willing to sacrifice the health of our climate, marine life, local economies, or coastal ecosystems to expand offshore drilling. The growth of offshore wind in the region further underscores the false choice being presented by my Republican colleagues. Virginians are already enhancing our energy security by harnessing the power of the wind. Thanks to the investments in the Inflation Reduction Act-- including provisions I introduced with Representatives Pascrell, Norcross, Luria, and the late Congressman McEachin--the future of offshore wind and domestic offshore wind manufacturing is bright. Virginians have repeatedly stood together to protect our coasts and, as this amendment demonstrates, we will continue to do so. I urge my colleagues to protect Virginia's coasts by supporting this amendment.",
              "my amendment would exclude the Southern California Planning Area from being leased for oil and gas production as part of any proposed plan under this bill. It is just over 1 year ago that our community experienced an oil spill that posed a grave ecological disaster that devastated local wildlife, our coasts and our ocean, and small business owners who rely on our coastal activity for their livelihoods. This kind of disaster is exactly why I introduced my American Coasts and Oceans Protection Act to prohibit any new leasing for the exploration, development, or production of oil or natural gas along the southern California coast, from San Diego up to San Luis Obispo. As I said when I introduced the bill last Congress, it is time to put our environment and our coastal economy first, not the out-of-state fossil fuel companies that profit while polluting our coastline. It is also important to note that our southern California economy relies heavily on ocean-based businesses. In San Diego and Orange County alone, the ocean economy accounts for roughly $7.7 billion in economic activity and sustains more than 140,000 jobs in coastal tourism and recreation. Along California's coastline, fishing, tourism, and recreation supports nearly 600,000 jobs and roughly $42.3 billion in economic activity. For every massive oil spill our region experiences, we are not only adding to the pollution of our oceans, but directly jeopardizing thousands of jobs. Mr. Speaker, the latest oil spill wasn't the first time our community has experienced such a disaster. More than 4 million gallons of oil have been released in the Pacific Ocean as a result of the 1969 Santa Barbara blowout, and the Refugio oil spill of 2015, and other leaks from oil rig and pipeline activity affecting more than 935 square miles of ocean. This most recent spill pushed that number even higher. Californians have made it clear that they are strongly opposed to additional offshore oil and gas drilling along our coast. The last administration repeatedly pushed to expand offshore drilling and rolled back crucial safety regulations that help prevent spills, and now here we are once again as Big Oil seeks to expand drilling off our coast, even as they sit on thousands of unused permits across the country. With so much ecological disaster and so many jobs threatened by offshore drilling, southern Californians have had enough. We need to be focusing on cutting emissions and protecting coastal communities from rising sea levels, not extracting more oil so fossil fuel executives can profit even more. Just yesterday, Chevron announced it is tripling its stock buyback program to $75 billion while reporting record profits. How much profit do they really need? The reality is, we need to end all new offshore oil and gas leasing in southern California, off the Pacific Coast and beyond. This amendment represents a start to making that happen. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment and respect the will of the vast majority of Californians, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike who oppose drilling off our coasts. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "H.R. 21 unnecessarily opens large swaths of public lands and waters to oil and gas drilling, including the coast of Florida. This would really jeopardize Florida's fragile offshore waters, our beautiful beaches. Clean water, clean air, clean beaches are central to our way of life, and are the cornerstone of our economy. For many years, the State of Florida has enjoyed a moratorium on drilling because leaders at the national level recognized that Florida beaches and our offshore waters were a national resource. That moratorium expired last year, unfortunately. So now with H.R. 21, Florida is at risk again. My amendment would reinstitute that moratorium. In fact, it would permanently ban drilling off of the coast of Florida. This has enjoyed bipartisan support here in the Congress and back home. How do Floridians feel about drilling off of our beaches? Well, we passed a constitutional amendment in 2018 that passed by almost 70 percent of the vote in the State of Florida. Democrats, Republicans, Independents, everyone values our way of life. Why? Because we are also keenly aware of how dirty it is, how risky it is. The impacts of oil drilling off our coast really came home to roost in 2010 after the BP Deepwater Horizon oil blowout severely affected the Gulf Coast marine ecosystems. Do you all remember that disaster, watching it day after day, month after month, after oil spewed into the Gulf of Mexico? At that time we were pretty fortunate on the West Coast of Florida, we didn't have oil that washed up on the beaches, but we were just coming out of the Great Recession. It was a hammer down on small business owners at that time. People were not coming to the Sunshine State. It caused enormous environmental impacts. I remember so well, holding in my arms and looking into the eyes of these small, mom and pop owners of motels and hotels and beach businesses, they were just devastated. We cannot put our economic and environment at risk again. It was a wake-up call. The eastern Gulf of Mexico also is an important military testing range. The Department of Defense has said they oppose oil drilling off the coast of Florida along the west coast because they do so many military training exercises. There are so many reasons that we need to act to protect our way of life, our environment, and our economy. It is what we sing about when we sing about protecting the Gulf Stream waters. This land is your land, this land is my land. They are not to be pillaged by the greed of the Big Oil companies. We are poised to make important progress on the health of our oceans and our economy. We are about to unleash the clean energy economy to create jobs, to lower costs for families, to build safer, healthier, and more resilient communities. We do not need to put our economy and our way of life at risk. So for all those reasons, I hope that all of the colleagues can join together to support the Castor amendment and permanently ban oil drilling off of the beautiful coastline of the State of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

              "I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1, which should be called the polluters over people act. This is a critical moment. Just last week, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its sixth and final assessment, which presents our most comprehensive understanding of climate science to date. It is not, as my colleague suggested, that you can go outside and breathe fresh air and decide that there is no climate change. Scientists have made it abundantly clear, there are two options: significantly cut emissions now or face catastrophic challenges ahead. Future generations will look back and scrutinize the decisions we make as leaders. Did we have the political courage to take action or did we ignore science, stifle the most vulnerable voices in our community, and leave a climate catastrophe for our children and grandchildren? In northwest Oregon, my home, smoke from raging wildfires made the air unhealthy to breathe, and in the summer of 2021 hundreds of people in the Pacific Northwest died from a 1 in 10,000 year heat dome event where temperatures reached 118 degrees. Acidic oceans are harming our fishing industries. That is from carbon pollution. Droughts and extreme weather patterns jeopardize the livelihoods of our farmers. Warmer temperatures in the Columbia River are further endangering salmon that are so vital to the region and indigenous peoples. H.R. 1 is a dangerous move in the wrong direction under the guise of promoting lower energy costs. It would do no such thing, and the American people will not be fooled. Instead, this bill is a package of anti-climate and anti-public lands policy that would undermine recent environmental protections, destroy the National Environmental Policy Act, and take a significant step back in the fight against climate change. The bill will also raise, not lower, costs for working families by repealing tax cuts the Democrats passed last year for home efficiency upgrades. It even repeals the methane emissions reduction program. While Americans faced higher gas prices, make no mistake, the top five big oil companies made record profits--more than $196 billion last year--that is more than the economic output of most countries. These companies abuse billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded subsidies, stockpiled thousands of unused leases on millions of acres of public lands and engage in price gouging at the pump. This bill? It advances policies that allow Big Oil to increase their profits, even more at the expense of our constituents. The bill would expedite dirty mining operations, exempt oil, gas, and drilling industries from adhering to important environmental regulations, shorten public review timelines, and limit public engagement. We must protect our bedrock environmental laws that safeguard communities and allow the public to have a say in local projects. We must continue the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, which finally, after so many years, will make significant investments we need to save our planet. Addressing the climate crisis cannot be delayed. We must defeat this bill and turn our attention to investments that create jobs.",
              "I rise in strong opposition to House Republicans' polluters over people act, H.R. 1. This dangerous bill appears to be doubling down on dirty fossil fuels to pad the profits of polluters and Big Oil. Our Republican friends seem to be oblivious to the fact that, as we speak, there are communities in this country devastated by extreme weather events, from deadly tornadoes to life-threatening atmospheric rivers to unprecedented snowfall. Instead of legislating with an eye toward the future, our colleagues across the aisle are bringing up a bill that pretends there is no climate crisis. Scientists agree that action on climate is literally life or death. The recent IPCC report that just came out reminds us that we are out of time. It is now or never if we want to spare our kids from a future that includes more frequent and even worse extreme weather events and more climate-driven food insecurity. The world's best climate scientists call this a climate time bomb. Our Republican colleagues call it a hoax, and they produce bills like this. My colleagues seem to want to talk about speeding up permitting. Great, let's talk about permitting. Democrats just secured $1 billion for permitting streamlining in the Inflation Reduction Act for that very purpose. Let me remind you, not a single Republican voted for that bill, which was actually a solution to accelerating clean energy. What are they trying to do instead? They are trying to claw back the funding that we approved. They are trying to slow down permitting and do the exact opposite of what they claim that they want to see with their so-called permitting reform package. If they want to protect this planet for future generations, then anyone who cares about that really needs to read the fine print of this bill because it would force agencies to hold oil and gas lease sales on public lands even if they are not needed. If these sales don't get enough bids, they are replaced with more sales, at lower prices. So we are not just giving away our public lands, we are doing it at laughably low prices, locking in these lands for oil and gas development for decades to come. This is not just extreme. It is obscene. The Inflation Reduction Act included multiple oil and gas leasing reforms, modest reforms, to ensure that the public finally gets a fair share for onshore and offshore fossil fuel development. If we are going to begin to address the impacts of the climate crisis, then ending massive fossil fuel subsidies is a pretty good place to start. Under this legislation, not only are we going in the opposite direction, we are removing even these modest provisions to allow taxpayers to finally get their fair share from the incredible profits that these polluting industries would receive. This legislation lowers royalty rates, repeals interest fees, reinstates noncompetitive leasing, and it does all of this while fossil fuel companies are rolling in record profits of $451 billion for the oil and gas industry last year. H.R. 1 is the biggest rollback of the Clean Water Act that we have seen in 50 years. It will remove important clean water protections for States and Tribal Governments specifically. Under current law, section 401 of the Clean Water Act gives States and Tribes authority to review water quality as well as requirements of State law on any project or activity that requires a Clean Water Act permit. This bill would slash that authority and shorten the time frame for which they can review such projects. Make no mistake, this will make it harder to protect the waterways and the communities that depend on clean water in this country. Whether you are in East Palestine or Philadelphia or anywhere else in this country, we should know better than to take something as critical as clean water for granted. I had an amendment that would retain these section 401 protections for Tribal Governments. This was a simple test because often some of my Republican colleagues say that they believe in Tribal sovereignty and they want to empower Tribal voices. So we came up with an amendment to let them do that, to just at least take away this terrible provision when it came to Tribal Governments. They declined to move that amendment forward. It was blocked. Why do our Republican colleagues want to block Tribal voices? One of the last details that we should note, if you listen to the debt ceiling debate, this cyclical, situational concern for fiscal conservatism which is coming around again, my colleagues on the other side shout from the rooftops now about the deficit. Well, guess what? This legislation is not just bad for people, not just bad for the planet, it is fiscally irresponsible. The CBO projects that it will add to the deficit. Just a reminder, the Inflation Reduction Act, which all of my friends voted against, paid for itself and reduced the deficit. Look, we do need to be talking about permit streamlining for clean energy infrastructure. This is very important. We need more efficient procedures to bring more renewable energy online, to modernize and upgrade electricity transmission facilities, but this bill doesn't even begin to touch any of that. That is our greatest need, and it is nowhere in this bill. If my Republican friends want to be taken seriously regarding permitting reform and not just giveaways to polluters, they need to offer real solutions. This package is not it. For the sake of the planet and future generations, I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. There are real, workable solutions to addressing our energy needs, extreme weather, food insecurity, and all of the downstream consequences of climate change, but this bill doesn't do it.",
              "Mr. Speaker, today I rise in urgent opposition to the Republicans' H.R. 1. Last week, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its final report. Their message couldn't be clearer. We have a lot to do and very little time to do it before the ticking climate bomb we are living in goes off. I want to emphasize that their message wasn't one of complete despair. There is hope. The hope hinges on two major conditions. One, we must stop burning fossil fuels, the number one cause of climate change. And two, we must transform our energy system to a cleaner and more sustainable one now. H.R. 1, the bill before us today, which has earned the fitting title of polluters over people act, will actively and aggressively take us backwards on both those accounts. Looking more like a nearly 200-page love letter to polluting industries than a serious legislative effort, the polluters over people act is a laundry list of gifts and giveaways to polluting industries. Let's look at what it does for Big Oil. For example, last year companies shattered profit records across the board by price gouging working Americans at the pump while also hoarding thousands of unused leases on our public lands and waters. Rather than hold Big Oil accountable for this abuse, the polluters over people act lowers royalty rates, repeals interest fees, reinstates noncompetitive leasing, and forces Federal agencies to hold rock-bottom lease sales all but assuring that last year's profit records will soon be broken again. Never to be outdone, the mining industry gets its fair share of gifts in H.R. 1, as well. Mining companies, many of which are foreign-owned, already enjoy a free-for-all on our public lands. They make a mockery of Tribal consultation, destroy sacred and special places, ruin the landscape, and leave behind a toxic mess that pollutes our water and hurts our health--all without paying a cent to the American people--not one red cent is paid in royalties. Now included in this package is that they can use the public land for anything they want, including dumping of toxic mineral waste. There is more, but suffice it to say, with all these handouts, it comes as no surprise that the Congressional Budget Office just reported last week that H.R. 1 will actually increase the Federal deficit. Staying true to its name, the polluters over people act also fast- tracks dirty energy projects by gutting our bedrock environmental and public health laws; namely, the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. This is not in a new so-called permitting reform solution they have come up with to address our energy needs. This is the same ideological attack I have seen Republicans in the Natural Resources Committee launch on NEPA year after year after year. For anyone who is being lured into thinking there are opportunities for negotiations on this bill--do not be naive. This performative permitting reform is not a bipartisan solution, not even a starting point for one. This is just another decades-old request from polluters to make their operations cheaper and easier, while making Americans' lives harder and more costly. It is not a serious solution to any of our energy goals. Even former President George W. Bush's head of permitting efforts has said that this bill will be ``of no statistically significant consequence.'' In fact, the polluters over people act has none of the real permitting solutions that can speed up the build-out of the clean energy infrastructure that we all need. One of those solutions would be increasing funding for Federal permitting offices, which is exactly what Democrats did when they secured more than $1 billion in last year's historic Inflation Reduction Act. Even Republicans' own witness at a hearing called that money ``wonderful.'' No more funding is in H.R. 1. Another solution for speeding up clean energy development is reforming the planning and cost allocation process for electrical transmission lines that can carry renewable energy from different sources across the country. But, no, you are not going to see that in H.R. 1 either. Of course, any real permitting reform solutions would make sure to protect and empower the communities that have been disproportionately hurt by dirty energy and other polluters for decades--and that are now being hit the hardest by climate change as well. As you can probably guess, H.R. 1 doesn't just fail to protect these communities, it silences them further, laying them bare to even more devastation, harm, and exploitation. The polluters over people act isn't just an embarrassment of riches for polluting industries, it is an embarrassment to our communities, to our climate goals, and to this legislative body. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, which includes the Water Quality Certification and Energy Project Improvement Act. That bill is the one that I introduced alongside my friend and colleague from Louisiana, Mr. Garret Graves. One of many key components in this package, this specific part of the bill helps ensure development of our Nation's energy infrastructure at a time when it is most necessary. This is accomplished by clarifying that projects subject to section 401 of the Clean Water Act are approved or denied based on water quality alone. Unlike what my colleagues have been saying on the other side of the aisle that we are going to permit dirty water, et cetera, et cetera, if it is related to water, guess what, section 401 still applies. The water quality certification process has been and continues to be weaponized by certain States to stifle important energy projects they oppose, particularly pipelines, for political reasons completely unrelated to water quality and outside the scope and the intent of the Clean Water Act. That is all this particular provision addresses. Instead of fairly analyzing a project based on the Federal standards set forth by Congress, what has happened is States on the East and West Coast have increasingly weaponized section 401 for their own ideological purposes, again totally and completely unrelated to water quality. Here are some examples: In my home State of North Carolina, the Mountain Valley Southgate project was denied, not because of water quality but because the deciding bureaucrats hold an inherent opposition to the project as a whole. Projects in Washington and New York have been denied due to noise and cultural resources. Nothing to do with water quality. These are just a few examples of the weaponization of section 401 of the Clean Water Act statute. The language that is included here in this package quite simply will end this abuse. At a time when American energy production and distribution is under tremendous assault from some in this country, ensuring that America can build the energy infrastructure necessary to responsibly utilize our natural resources, unleash American energy independence, and lower costs for American families is a top priority that this broader bill achieves. Let me put it this way: Low cost, reliable energy is fundamental to prosperity. It isn't the only critical aspect necessary for a nation and her people to be prosperous, but it is awfully hard for a nation to be prosperous without it. Low cost and reliable energy helps America to produce more goods and therefore put downward pressure on inflation, and, boy, do we need all the help we can get. It will enable America to be energy dominant again, increasing American strength abroad. Put another way, it is critical to our economy, our food security, and our national security. That is why this legislation is so badly needed at this critical time in American history. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Lower Energy Costs Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1, particularly division C, which was introduced in the House as H.R. 1152, and was marked up by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure with strong opposition from my Democratic colleagues. The polluters over the people act let polluters off the hook for harmful actions and damaging impacts to our rivers, lakes, and our streams that our local communities rely on for clean, safe drinking water. Division C is an attack on section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which is a key mechanism for States and Tribes to evaluate projects that cross within their borders and have an impact on their waters and environment for decades. Section 401 has been a successful example of cooperative federalism, while preserving State authority to manage their natural resources. Section 401 has been a well-supported, effective tool since the beginning of the Clean Water Act, but the Trump administration found a way to make it a scapegoat for the failure of senseless and harmfully polluting mega-projects. The provisions in the polluters over people act will tie the hands of States and Tribes seeking to preserve stream flow for their water supplies, to prevent runoff and water pollution, and to minimize impacts to flood-preventing wetlands. It goes against the Clean Water Act's rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution. First, in California, this bill would have huge impacts. For one, limiting analysis to only discharges would mean the State would be unable to consider the impact of the whole project, such as increasing impervious surfaces, or considering downstream effects. Our State is trying to preserve every drop of water we can get. Yet, this bill would stop my State from protecting its water supply from the adverse impacts of projects pursued by out-of-State interests. Second, this bill places arbitrary, and likely impossible timelines on the States to act on permit requests. Despite how complicated or huge the project might be, this bill will severely limit the time allowed for a State to review its impact. My friends across the aisle may not realize this, but this bill may lead to greater numbers of project rejections as the State is pressured to respond without the time to fully analyze the project. This bill is another attempt to gut--really gut--the Clean Water Act and allow pollution and industry to act without repercussion. We must defend human health, our economy, and the natural environment, and oppose the damaging bill that will harm local communities. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the State of California, State of Washington, and the State of New York in strong opposition to H.R. 1152, which is the bill that became division C, H.R. 1. February 28, 2023. Hon. Chairman Graves, Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Graves: As the water quality certifying agencies for California, New York, and Washington, we write to underscore the importance of existing law in protecting state waters from water pollution associated with federally licensed projects. On February 24, 2023, Representatives Rouzer and Graves introduced H.R. 1152--Water Quality Certification and Energy Project Improvement Act of 2023, to amend section 401 of the Clean Water Act that would, among other things, revise section 401 to: (1) reduce the scope of states' and tribes' 401 water quality certification authority to apply only to the discharge to a water of the United States, rather than the whole of the activity; (2) narrow states' and tribes' section 401 water quality certification authority to exclude much of what is required to comply with water quality standards and implementation plans under section 303 of the Clean Water Act; (3) remove the states' and tribes' authority to ensure compliance with ``other appropriate requirement[s] of State law''; (4) replace references to an ``application'' for certification with a ``request'' for certification; and (5) impose a time requirement on states and tribes to identify information needed before taking an action on a certification request, (6) make other changes to the law that introduce substantial uncertainty about the scope of section 401 for project proponents and state and tribes. Each of these changes would undermine states' abilities to protect water quality within their states and erode five decades of successful, cooperative federalism. We ask that Congress preserve the existing state authority in the Clean Water Act to substantively review a project's effects on water quality before a federal permit or license is issued. Background Under section 401 of the Clean Water Act, a federal agency may not issue a permit or license to conduct any activity that may result in any discharge into waters of the United States unless a section 401 water quality certification is issued, or certification is waived. The State Water Resources Control Board (``State Water Board'') and the nine California Regional Water Quality Control Boards (collectively, ``Water Boards''), [NY Signatory], [WA Signatory] are certifying agencies pursuant to section 401 of the Clean Water Act. In all three states, the most common federal licenses subject to section 401 are Clean Water Act section 404 dredge or fill permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and licenses for hydropower facilities issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. During the five decades since Congress enacted section 401 in the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970, state water quality agencies diligently processed thousands of section 401 requests each year with little controversy. The vast majority of section 401 certifications were issued promptly and most section 401 certifications were granted, with only a handful of denials issued each year. Beginning around 2016, prompted by a handful of high-profile section 401 denials, some project applicants and industry lobbyists began claiming that states were ``abusing'' their section 401 authority. Such claims of abuse are not, and never have been, true. In the handful of cases when project applicants have alleged improper certification decisions or delay by state agencies, they have been fully capable of protecting their rights under section 401 through the traditional framework of administrative and judicial review. Section 401 is a cornerstone of the cooperative federalism principles enshrined by the Clean Water Act Cooperative federalism is a foundational component of the Clean Water Act. As set forth in Clean Water Act section 101 (b), ``[i]t is the policy of the Congress to recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution'' and ``to plan the development and use . . . of land and water resources.'' Section 510 further specifies that except as expressly provided, nothing in the Clean Water Act shall preclude or deny the right of any State to adopt or enforce any standard or limitation respecting discharges of pollutants or any requirement respecting control or abatement of pollution. The section 401 certification program is an embodiment of these cooperative federalism principles. A state certification is the mechanism of ensuring that a federal license or permit is not used as an excuse to violate state or federal water quality standards. As currently written, the language in section 401 acknowledges that states are in the best position to understand their own laws and that additional conditions may be necessary to ensure compliance with state law and applicable Clean Water Act requirements. As the federal permitting or licensing agency is often not an agency primarily tasked with managing environmental issues, the federal agency may in fact be reliant on the certification authority's expertise regarding water quality. To prevent a section 401 certification from becoming a rubber stamp, any revision to the section 401 language must preserve an expansive view of the cooperative federalism principles originally envisioned by the Clean Water Act and repeatedly affirmed by the Supreme Court. PUD No. 1 of Jefferson Cnty. v. Washington Dep't of Ecology, 511 U.S. 700 (1994); S.D. Warren Co. v. Maine Bd. of Env't Prot., 547 U.S. 370 (2006). The Clean Water Act should continue to protect the whole range of water quality effects resulting from the proposed activity We strongly support the existing statutory language, which gives states and tribes the authority to regulate the potentially water-polluting activity as a whole, rather than being limited to a strict interpretation of effects from only the discharge, because regulation of the activity as a whole protects waters from the widest range of impacts. States should be able to protect water quality regardless of whether the pollution or other water quality impacts would be specifically attributable to a discharge or from some other aspect of the activity being permitted. States should be able to use the certification process to address impacts to groundwater, impacts to isolated surface waters, or impacts from non-point sources, all of which are likely not directly attributable to the discharge to a water of the United States, because these are water quality impacts that would not occur without issuance of the federal permit or license. The problems with limiting certifications to the discharge rather than the whole of the activity would be particularly impactful on the states' ability to protect water quality during the decades long term of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``FERC'') licenses in the hydropower licensing context. States and tribes must be able to fully address the water quality impacts of such activities as a whole during the 30- to 50-year term of the FERC license to reduce water quality impacts that, depending on the circumstances, may not be attributable to a point-source discharge, but result from the activity's construction, operations, and facilities. Common water quality impacts associated with hydropower activities include changes in turbidity, sediment, siltation, temperature, habitat loss, alterations to stream geomorphology, dissolved oxygen, algal productivity and algal-produced toxins, erosion, barriers to fish passage, alterations to stream geomorphology, and reductions in stream flow. Each of these impacts can have profound, generational impacts on the state's water resources. To prevent or minimize these potential impacts, states have imposed, or considered the need for certification conditions to protect water quality on project activities that fall outside the typical understanding of point-source discharges, such as requirements for minimum instream flows and ramping rates; temperature management; aquatic invasive species management; plans for gravel replenishment, large woody material placement and other habitat measures; reservoir operation plans; erosion and sediment management plans; and monitoring and management of dissolved oxygen, mercury, pesticides, and other constituents of concerns. Previously issued certifications have typically included management, monitoring, and reporting measures to ensure compliance with water quality measures and to identify potential modifications if circumstances change. Revising the statutory language to contradict longstanding interpretations would introduce confusion and invite arguments about the nexus between the discharge and the impact, when a state or tribe's focus should more appropriately be on all water quality impacts resulting from the project. Introducing the concept of whether the activity will ``directly result'' in a discharge in subsection (a)(1) and (a)(4) would inject additional uncertainty and potentially further limit the certifying authority's ability to protect water quality. Although the states would rely on their state authority to continue to preserve robust protection of water quality whenever possible, state authority would not be an available remedy where state law is preempted by federal law. Because the Federal Power Act preempts the field of hydropower regulation absent an express exception to preemption, and FERC project licenses are valid for a fixed period of up to 50 years, water quality certifications for FERC license applications provide the states with a singular opportunity to ensure compliance with the state's water quality standards and other requirements. If the states' ability to regulate FERC licensed projects to the same extent that it has been able to for decades is significantly weakened, other, non- FERC projects would be subject to more stringent requirements to compensate for the failure of FERC-licensed projects to contribute what would otherwise be their allocated responsibility. The Clean Water Act should continue to authorize certifications to implement water quality standards and implementation plans adopted or approved under section 303 of the Clean Water Act Under section 401 of the Clean Water Act a water quality certification implements the applicable provisions of sections 301, 302, 303, 306 and 307 of the Clean Water Act and any other appropriate requirement of state law. The most important of the enumerated provisions of the Clean Water Act is section 303, which provides for water quality standards and implementation plans. Section 303 requires development and approval of water quality standards, which consist of designated uses, criteria, and anti-degradation policies; establishment of total maximum daily loads, which allocate responsibility for meeting standards that cannot be met solely through compliance with the technology-based requirements of the Clean Water Act; and implementation of a continuing planning process. In 1994, the Supreme Court upheld state authority to set conditions of certification to protect uses designated as part of the water quality standards under section 303. PUD No. 1, 511 U.S. at 700. The Court rejected an argument that certification is limited to implementing the criteria component of those standards. Consistent with the Supreme Court's ruling, states have made effective use water quality certification authority to protect water quality needed for commercial, tribal, and recreational fisheries and other important uses of state waters. The proposed revision to limit ``applicable provisions'' of section 303 to ``requirement of state law implementing water quality criteria under section 303 necessary to support the designated use or uses of the receiving navigable waters'' could strip the states' authority to use their certification authority to protect the uses of waters of the United States designated as part of water quality standards under section 303. By inexplicably omitting any reference to federal requirements that implement section 303, it would also create substantial uncertainty about states' and tribes' ability to enforce water quality criteria, total maximum daily loads, and antidegradation requirements adopted by U.S. EPA. Congress should not remove the states' authority to require compliance with state water quality requirements We strongly oppose the bill's proposed revisions that would limit the certifying authority to ensuring compliance with only specific sections of the Clean Water Act by deleting the existing reference to ``any other appropriate requirement of State law'' set forth in section 401 subsection (d). Such a revision would disregard a state's right to impose more stringent water quality requirements and be contrary to the protective goals of the Clean Water Act. As is accounted for and endorsed by the Clean Water Act, many states have state-based programs and attendant requirements that arguably or explicitly expand beyond the state's Clean Water Act authorities. The Clean Water Act expressly contemplated a state's authority to establish and enforce more stringent state requirements beyond the Clean Water Act. For example, certifications may include monitoring and reporting requirements that arguably go beyond ensuring compliance with specific sections of the Clean Water Act, and instead help determine whether water quality is being degraded or to shape the development of future actions to protect water quality. We urge Congress to refrain from making an unwarranted intrusion into a state's authority to impose stricter conditions to protect the quality of waters within its borders. Section 401 should preserve the certifying authority's ability to define the contents of a request for certification and create submission procedures The bill proposes revising references to ``application'' to be ``request.'' Although the intention behind that revision is not clear, we support language that recognizes that the certifying authority may define the contents of a request for certification and create submission procedures. The state's ability to define what is required for a request for certification is significant because a receipt of such a request is the trigger for the beginning of the reasonable period of time for a certifying authority to act on the request. The bill proposes an addition requiring certifying authorities to ``publish requirements for certification,'' but it is not clear whether this language is an indirect reference to a certifying authority's ability to define required information for applications and submittal procedures. To the extent that ``requirements'' were intended to require the enactment of new state regulations, 30 days is insufficient time to comply with public notice and comment requirements for State Water Board adoption. Section 401 should not impose an arbitrary time limit on the certifying authority's ability to request information The bill proposes revisions to subsection (a)(1) that specify that by 90 days after request for a certification, the certifying authority must inform the applicant if any additional information is necessary for the certification authority to take an action on the request. As explained above, to the extent that the language requires the certifying authority to identify what, if any, information is necessary to submit a complete application for water quality certification, many state laws, including California's, do this. But the revised language may be construed as preventing the states from requesting that the applicant clarify, amplify, correct, or supplement information required in the application, which is permissible under state law. For these reasons, we write to ask that Congress preserve the existing state authority in Clean Water Act Section 401 to substantively review a project's effects on water quality before a federal permit or license is issued, and protect five decades of successful, cooperative federalism.

              "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of clean water and in support of the Clean Water Act, and in opposition to H.R. 1, the polluters over people act. Clean water is a basic human right--the health and safety of our communities and the success of our economy depends on it. House Democrats stand for clean water. Last Congress, we passed a historic and bipartisan investment in our Nation's infrastructure through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The BIL included almost $13 billion in clean water infrastructure upgrades and is creating jobs in communities across the country. The Clean Water Act, passed in 1972, is one of the most successful environmental laws in our Nation's history. It has protected rivers, lakes, and streams from pollution and contamination, ensuring that we have access to clean and safe water. Section 401 of the Clean Water Act allows States to review projects that could impact their water quality. For 50 years, States have used this authority to protect their water resources, and it has helped them ensure that projects move forward only if clean water would not be compromised as a result. These proposals that are in H.R. 1, to narrow the scope of section 401, are a misguided effort at permitting reform. By limiting the ability of States to review projects, we are sacrificing the health of our communities and our environment for the sake of expedience and profit. I recognize the majority's interest in ensuring that permitting requirements are not insurmountable barriers to investment. I share the goal of speeding up project delivery. Last Congress, I supported not only the BIL, but also the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. These laws showed what Congress is capable of when it focuses on addressing the real needs of American families. I want these laws and their investments to be successful. However, to quickly put these investments to work, we need a robust partnership between the Federal Government and its State and local partners and Tribal partners, to address State, local, and Tribal requirements, and to ensure community buy-in before these investments are implemented. To be effective, that process must build on a mutual trust between the parties because any effort to force that process often results in opposition, delay, and litigation. Yet, H.R. 1 misses the mark by stifling local participation and buy- in, which will only result in these projects taking longer to implement. In fact, State organizations, such as the Western States Water Council, believe that placing arbitrary and strict limits on section 401 application review times and processes will require the States ``to issue an increased number of denials, due to inflexible deadlines that do not accommodate State public engagement laws or allow sufficient time to gather adequate information on project impacts.'' Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 1, and reject the efforts to weaken the Clean Water Act and our Nation's other bedrock environmental laws. We must protect our water resources for future generations and for the health of today's communities and families. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "Mr. Speaker, the amendment that I have proposed to the Lower Energy Costs Act will help Congress identify harmful regulations that have shut down American energy and increased costs on all Americans. This amendment instructs the EPA to identify and access existing regulations that have negatively impacted the United States' energy independence and energy security. This amendment will provide transparency about the actions taken by the Biden administration to increase regulatory burdens for energy producers, diminish energy output for the United States, and raise the cost of energy for all Americans. I grew up working in the west Texas oil fields, so I know firsthand that the best thing we can do for energy producers in our country is to get the Federal Government out of the way and reduce the number of burdensome regulations. Unfortunately, from day one, President Biden has waged war on American energy and done everything in his power to undo all the incredible work of the Trump administration to make our country energy independent. Since January 2021, the EPA has recklessly issued new rules and regulations with no regard for their adverse effects on Americans and our energy security. They have continued to diminish America's energy independence and take aim at America's interests and citizens without meaningful consultation with industry leaders or a logical plan to move forward. It is time we identify the EPA regulations that have played a direct role in shutting down our energy production and added additional expenses to the already burdensome day-to-day cost of living for Americans. As many of my Republican colleagues have mentioned, H.R. 1 is just the beginning of our work on critical energy solutions that will lift the red tape and expand the production of affordable and reliable energy rather than hamstring our domestic producers. The underlying bill is a strong piece of legislation that will reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign energy sources and get us back on track to putting America first. My amendment strengthens an already good bill and will allow Congress to pinpoint EPA regulations that negatively impact American families, small businesses, the agriculture industry, and our national security. We must show Americans that we will not stand by while the EPA puts the needs of the environmental special interest groups ahead of the needs of the American people. While some may wrongfully speak out against H.R. 1, this is an incredibly strong bill, and it is only the beginning of what the House majority is going to accomplish to unleash American energy. My amendment is a commonsense addition to the bill, and it instructs the EPA to conduct an after-action review to make sure we are doing what is in the best interests of our country. I urge every Member in this body to support my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I frankly don't understand the purpose of this amendment. Last spring, FERC issued an updated policy statement, an interim guidance, detailing how the Commission should treat new applications for natural gas pipelines and account for greenhouse gas emissions. The Commission, a month later, clarified that both documents were drafts and that it would seek further input and comments on the drafts. That is it. These documents are not final rules or orders from the Commission. They are not law. They are a draft, draft documents that the Commission has put out to solicit industry and stakeholder feedback, and that is the way we want the government to work for it to be responsive. Withdrawing these documents from draft status, which is what I think the gentleman's amendment would do, would have no impact on any policy and, instead, I think, would just create further confusion and possibly release FERC from the duty to consider industry's comments on the draft. It may be that the real reason that the Republicans offered this amendment is that they don't think that FERC should consider greenhouse gas emissions. They don't think that these emissions should matter when FERC makes a decision about whether or not to authorize a new natural gas pipeline. This doesn't change the law. The law currently requires FERC to consider the greenhouse gas impacts of a certificate it grants. Multiple Federal court rulings have held that the agency must think about these issues based on the statute, and the interim policy statement was meant to create certainty for industry on how the Commission would do that. Instead, Republicans want to send FERC and, frankly, all parts of the Federal Government back into confusion. If you want to say that FERC shouldn't consider greenhouse gases--I am not in favor of that--you should amend the statute to say that. By simply saying that these draft rules should be withdrawn, that is going to tell industry, how do you deal with this? How are they going to know what to do if there are no rules, no policy, no input from them whatsoever? I think it would be wrong to change the statute to say that they shouldn't take greenhouse gas impacts into consideration, but that is not what this amendment does. This amendment says to just get rid of these drafts, and then industry would have no input into any of this. I don't think industry would support that. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment simply requires Federal agencies to certify that they have the staffing capacity to meet the new environmental timelines established under this bill. According to the Government Accountability Office, the main reason for project delays at the Federal level is a lack of agency resources and staff capacity. Thankfully, we helped address this challenge by securing $1 billion in the IRA to ensure Federal agencies have the resources and expertise to conduct efficient environmental reviews. A trained, equipped workforce is essential to processing environmental reviews in a timely fashion in cases where there are delays. Increasing the funding and staff for Federal agencies' permitting offices and agency workforce training is already making the permitting process significantly more effective and efficient in a responsible way. Unfortunately, instead of building on the progress we made in the Inflation Reduction Act and supporting agencies' capacity to conduct reviews by providing additional resources, H.R. 1 takes the more politically expedient but impractical approach of simply forcing agencies onto stricter timelines for reviews without providing additional resources for Federal agencies to conduct these reviews. By instituting these strict deadlines and limiting opportunities for community input throughout this bill, I am worried that instead of leading to more efficient project reviews and approvals, H.R. 1 may actually lead to sloppier and rushed reviews. When environmental reviews are not thorough, projects often face a litany of time- consuming lawsuits and litigation. As some may know, I used to work on clean energy projects before coming to Congress, and my own experience is that detailed environmental reviews and a thoughtful permitting process alongside early engagement with impacted communities can facilitate more efficient completion of projects and better overall outcomes. This amendment would help support efficient reviews by requiring that the Council on Environmental Quality in consultation with affected Federal agencies certify that all agencies have the funding and staffing capacity to meet the new timelines for environmental review required under the bill. It is common sense that we should not be instituting arbitrary timelines if agencies don't have the necessary resources to meet them. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to ensure that affected agencies have the resources needed to conduct high-quality reviews, which will lead to better overall project outcomes. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

              "there was some discussion earlier and an allegation made that Democrats have yet to introduce any policy to reduce our energy costs, as if we have completely forgotten about the sweeping, multibillion-dollar investments in the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce people's costs across the board. I am rising today to stand in opposition to H.R. 1. While Republicans try to claim that this is a bill to lower people's energy costs, what we really see when we start digging into it, is that what this bill actually shows us by the Republican authors is that they actually have no plan to reduce our utility bills or even prevent climate disaster in the United States. The central argument and logic of this bill is that if you give Big Oil everything they want, then perhaps they will lower our gas prices. It is a form of trickle-down fantasy that just will not make life easier for everyday Americans. What H.R. 1 will do is give Big Oil more leases of public lands. This idea that an increased supply of fossil fuels will drive down prices is also mistaken. Let's look at what happened last year. We saw how Big Oil more than doubled its profits to $219 billion, all while price gouging customers at the pump, not because of supply issues but because they can. Republicans opposed solutions that we put forward, like a windfall tax on price gouging on Big Oil in order to prevent these kinds of behaviors. Fossil fuel companies, moreover, already have thousands of unused permits on public lands, yet they want even more. This is not a problem of supply. It is a problem of greed and abuse of market power. I, along with many of my colleagues, called for that windfall tax. What does this bill do instead? It is almost as if you gave a pen to an oil lobbyist and wrote down everything that they want. Much of that is in this bill. We are looking at reducing Big Oil's royalty rates to the public and slashing interest fees. For people following at home, if you are a member of the American public, if you are a taxpaying citizen, you are part of the ownership of our public lands. When an oil company decides to lease that land, they are supposed to pay a royalty to the public. What does H.R. 1 do? It slashes that royalty rate so that there is very little payback or investment into the American people and many of our programs. In this bill, Republicans are squarely on the side of fossil fuel companies. It makes it harder for communities to fight Big Oil when they don't want them drilling in their own backyards. It also threatens our public lands and allows anyone to stake a mining claim on our public lands for less than $10 an acre, even if they haven't discovered any minerals. Despite the fact that more than 40 percent of Americans live in counties hit by climate disasters, this bill prohibits agencies from even considering climate change when deciding whether or not to issue a permit to a drilling company. None of these things are going to lower our costs at the pump. None of these things are going to actually reduce our utility bills. In fact, in talking about this allegation of a lack of Democrat proposals, Democrats introduced 95 amendments, proposed 95 amendments to this bill, and the Republican majority rejected all but seven. I, myself, personally sponsored an amendment in the spirit of this bill, allegedly, to try to reduce prices, and my amendment would have made sure that the subsidies that the Federal Government provides to oil and gas companies actually make their way to the American people-- instead of lining the pockets of billionaire CEOs--and actually have the intended effect. Republicans rejected that amendment, too. They have made clear where they stand. I cannot emphasize enough how detrimental and damaging this bill would be, not only to the climate crisis, not only to the purpose of even trying to reduce our utility costs, but moreover, for the ability for the American people to actually receive an investment on the public lands that they lease out.",
              "I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we are here today to consider a rule for H.R. 1, a bill that might as well be called the polluters over people act. It is yet another example of how this majority, instead of helping everyday Americans, is doing the bidding of their deep-pocketed friends. We had another mass shooting yesterday, but Republicans won't lift a finger because of the gun lobby. We had another train derailment this week, but Republicans won't lift a finger because of the polluters. Our planet is on fire, but Republicans won't lift a finger because of Big Oil. Banks are going under, but Republicans want to deregulate more to help their friends on Wall Street. They want to protect kids from what teachers teach in the classroom but not against lead pipes in schools. They say they want to stop inflation but won't go after the billionaire corporations who aren't paying any taxes while they rip people off. Time after time after time, Republicans continue to put politics over people, and it shows. Anyone who spends 2 seconds reading this bill can see that it is a dirty energy, pro-polluter plan that would drag our economy back decades. This bill puts polluters over people. It makes it easier for companies to strip public lands of their resources and harder to hold corporate polluters accountable for the mess they make. It gives more handouts to Big Oil, as if the industry's CEOs and shareholders haven't already raked in enough money with record profits over the last few years. It guts half a century of environmental protections that ensure the air we breathe and the water we drink is clean, and it sets our country back as the rest of the world moves toward a clean energy future. There will be plenty of time for us to talk about all the damage the polluters over people act could do to our country and communities, but let me just highlight a few of the worst. First, it increases the national deficit by half a billion dollars. Considering how much we hear from our colleagues across the aisle about the deficit and the deficit and the deficit, it is fascinating that their most important bill blows a hole in the deficit. So much for their commitment to fiscal discipline. Don't take my word for it, just consult the CBO. It is a little bit ironic on a day that they are asking that there be dramatic cuts in all kinds of programs that help people in this country, they come up with this bill and add close to a half a billion dollars to our deficit. Second, it is a job killer. This bill will kill jobs. Over the last few years, Democrats have invested in building a homegrown, clean energy system so we don't have to rely on foreign cartels like OPEC and greedy Big Oil companies for our energy. Investing in these clean energy projects meant we created millions of clean energy jobs. The polluters over people act would kill these jobs and pull our country off course from our path toward a cleaner, cheaper energy future. Third, it makes it easier to pollute, and it makes it easier for companies to get away with polluting. Just yesterday, a local grandfather in East Palestine, Ohio, detailed the pain caused by the terrible toxic spill there. He said he has ``never cried this much in his life.'' His young granddaughters developed blotches all over their bodies, and their eyes were burning. This bill would mean more billionaire corporations getting away with polluting without being held accountable, more wells with toxic chemicals, more days where windows are shut because the air is not safe to breathe, more kids diagnosed with asthma because the air quality is so poor. The worst part is that the Republicans do not care. Their bill literally puts polluters over the people we are here to serve. It forces American taxpayers to foot the bill for cleanup while billionaire corporations dump their toxic waste on our communities. This is sick. Look at what is happening to our planet, Mr. Speaker. Year after year, the warmest ever recorded; species going extinct at rates not seen in millions of years; sea levels rising and coastal communities feeling the impact; farmers struggling to cope with changing seasons, unprecedented droughts, and crop failures. The answer from my Republican friends is more fossil fuels, more pollution, more drilling, more toxic waste dumped into our communities, more giveaways for Big Oil, and nothing, not a single thing, to lower energy prices. This bill might as well put ExxonMobil and Chevron in charge of our response to climate change. It might as well put Norfolk Southern in charge of chemical safety. It is a terrible bill that will shackle us to dirty fossil fuels for generations to come. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1. The Republicans call it the Lower Energy Costs Act. In fact, it does the opposite, and it puts polluters over people, so we call it the polluters over people act. That is justified because that is exactly what it does. This bill is nothing more than a grab bag of Big Oil giveaways and loopholes that endanger the health, safety, and security of Americans. It does absolutely nothing to lower energy costs for American families. In fact, it will actually drive up costs while doubling down on costly fossil fuels. Now, does the GOP really believe that Big Oil cares about Americans? During the COVID crisis in the last 3 years, we had a hearing where we brought in some of the large oil companies. It was quite clear that they wanted to keep prices high. It was quite clear that they were benefiting from OPEC and the fact that Russia had invaded Ukraine and that oil supplies had become more limited because of that invasion of Ukraine and that as a result, prices for oil and gasoline were going up. They didn't care. They liked it. We actually asked them at the hearing whether or not they would increase production because they have so many leases on Federal lands that they don't use, and they said no. They said maybe eventually they would do that, but they haven't gotten around to it yet. I don't think they have gotten around to it still. So this notion that somehow by benefiting Big Oil, the major American so-called oil companies, that this is going to help the American people, that is not their goal. Last year, Big Oil's profits in 2022 were $451 billion, a record high. The dividends they gave out and the stock buyouts amounted to $163 billion. They only care about the stockholders. They don't care about the price of gasoline. They want it to stay high. They don't care whether Americans can afford gasoline. Chairwoman Rodgers, who I really respect a lot, talked about LNG. One of the things in the bill is it removes the requirement--and I am going to talk about other things it does--but it removes the requirement that liquified natural gas exports be determined to be in the public interest before being sent overseas. That is going to lead to more American LNG being sent to our adversaries, including China. This helps China. This doesn't hurt China. This helps China. We know that there was a time a few years ago when LNG exports were limited because of--I forget what caused it--and during that period of time, the evidence shows the price for American gasoline or American crude was actually going down. When you send LNG overseas, it is not available here in the United States. That actually lowers gas prices when you have more gasoline available or more refineries available to process gasoline here in the United States. I debunk this idea that somehow this bill is going to lower prices here, that somehow benefiting Big Oil benefits Americans, that somehow exporting more LNG hurts China. These things simply are not the case. The evidence proves very much to the contrary. This bill, H.R. 1, I will call it the polluters over people act, rescinds several transformational climate programs that the Democrats enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act last year. What I am trying to get across today is that at the same time that they are helping Big Oil, not driving down prices, and helping China, the Republicans are also tearing down all of the environmental laws that we have had for the last 50 years and putting all the emphasis on fossil fuels rather than clean energy. The bottom line is, the only way that we are going to lower costs is by encouraging clean energy. Yes, I agree with Chairwoman Rodgers that the United States has to be a bigger energy producer, but the future for that is with clean energy, not with pumping more oil and gas. It is by encouraging clean energy because that is where we can be the big producer. That is where the future is. That is where we can outcompete the rest of the world. What does this bill do? It foolishly repeals the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which invests in high-impact projects that reduce pollution, creates good-paying clean energy jobs, and improves public health. They obviously do not want to do anything for clean energy. It also repeals the methane emissions reduction program, which protects the health of our communities and ensures that polluters, not taxpayers or customers, pay for wasted methane. Let me use that as an example. I want everyone to understand that when we passed the Inflation Reduction Act and we were trying to cut back on greenhouse gases which lead to global climate problems and the increase in global warming, we worked hard to deal with those industries here that could be affected. The Methane Emissions Reduction Act is a perfect example that we worked with the independent oil producers because they said, well, if you cause the methane that is wasted now and goes into the atmosphere and causes this increased number of greenhouse gases, if you work with us, we can accomplish capturing this methane and then it can be recycled, but we need some money to accomplish that. We provided them with a fund so they could make that transition. We also said that if it took them time to get a permit to capture the gas and provide a recycling program for the methane, that they would not be penalized by doing that. This has been characterized by the GOP as some sort of tax or fee on the industry. It is really a penalty if they don't do what is necessary to capture methane and avoid it going into the atmosphere. The same is true for almost every provision that they seek to repeal here. These are provisions that try to protect the public health, reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but at the same time don't have a negative impact on those industries that are hiring people and that create jobs. At the same time, try to move toward new clean energy things like wind, solar, and more hydropower, and other things that actually do create more jobs, as we have proven that they have. There are so many other things that repeal--I won't go through all of them because I know that we have other speakers. The bill also repeals the popular home electrification rebates that are specifically designed to lower energy bills for American families. These are popular incentives that will save families money and are urgently needed to help us fight the climate crisis. Republicans are rejecting all these things that help people save money, help reduce greenhouse gases so they can double-down on the old pro-polluter policies that they have had for years. This bill also does nothing to meaningfully address permitting reform. Its vision of permitting consists of letting polluters do whatever they want, and instead, the bill becomes a sweetheart deal. The bill, for example, doesn't include any changes to the transmission policy necessary to ensure that clean energy can reach all corners of the country. Let me also give you a couple of other examples. The biggest thing that they do to basically endanger all of our environmental protections is they exempt so-called critical energy resources from the Clean Air Act and hazardous waste permitting requirements. They say if we label a refinery or if we label a utility as a critical energy resource, then they don't have to follow the Clean Air Act, they don't have to follow the Clean Water Act, and they don't have to follow the Hazardous Waste Act. It is a roundabout way of saying that we are just going to let all these industries do whatever they want, even though it undercuts public health protections. They do the same thing with toxic chemicals. We had a major toxic chemical bill to try to cut back on toxic chemicals that needlessly expose families and children to health risks. They basically get rid of that by saying, oh, those facilities don't have to worry about releasing toxic chemicals. Mr. Speaker, I end by saying this. Democrats understand that the transition to clean energy is important. In fact, projects already underway are valued at tens of billions of dollars and have already created more than 100,000 good-paying jobs. Our Inflation Reduction Act is estimated to create 9 million new jobs over the coming decade and reduce energy costs by an average of $1,800 per year. What we have done in the last few years as Democrats is to try to move toward clean energy, understanding that you still have to have fossil fuels and nuclear and other things, but understanding that the future in terms of the U.S. being a major energy producer is in clean energy, not in fossil fuels. To just wreck and put a bulldozer through all our environmental protections in order to encourage fossil fuels is just a huge mistake. It is not going to lower energy costs. It is going to make it much more difficult for us to reduce greenhouse gases and all the negative impacts of climate change. There is nothing in here. In my opinion, this bill is also going to hurt us from a national security point of view because it does actually help China and help our adversaries rather than making it more difficult for them to compete with us. Mr. Speaker, I would urge opposition to the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time."

              "I appreciate the opportunity to debate and consider my amendment to encourage local hiring and recruitment, but I also want to note my disappointment that my friends across the aisle rejected any consideration of my other two amendments on this floor. One of those amendments would allow the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to prevent exploratory mining from taking place on Federal land if it would negatively impact our water, farmers, Tribes, or local communities. In New Mexico, ``agua es vida''; ``water is life.'' It shouldn't be controversial to protect our waters from mining contamination for our people, farmers, and environment. My other amendment would have simply stated that this bill would not go into effect until the Federal Government certified that it would lower costs for American consumers and save taxpayers money. If this bill is really designed to lower energy costs for American consumers and taxpayers, let's verify that before putting polluters over people. Again, I appreciate the opportunity to consider my amendment, which would require local units of the Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, and National Park Service to conduct an outreach plan to disseminate and advertise local civil service positions with functions relating to permitting and natural resources in their offices. Each plan must include outreach to local high schools, community colleges, institutions of higher education, and other relevant institutions. The BLM, the Forest Service, and the National Park Service field offices, and ranger districts and sites are stewards of our lands and waters, but they also operate within communities within which they are located, whether it is Cuba or Farmington or Roswell, New Mexico. Adequate staffing at these offices and their headquarters, and our Federal agencies more broadly, is critical to our ability to effectively steward our natural resources and environment and move projects through the permitting process efficiently, responsibly, and with an ear tuned in to what the local communities need. Unfortunately, we are seeing many of our agencies struggle to fill vacancies and staff up. For example, an E&E News article from last year said there are vacancy counts for all BLM State offices; the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho; the Bureau's National Operations Center in Denver; and the other directorates. To be clear, I know BLM and other Federal agencies are working hard to address these challenges. My amendment would take another step to help address the staffing challenges by making sure local offices are communicating with the local communities about open positions. Whether it is New Mexico Highlands University, Eastern New Mexico University, or Navajo Tech, I believe we should be taking advantage of talent in the communities where these offices are located. To be clear, once again, we must also provide our Federal agencies with the resources and tools they need and support our Federal workforce along the way. The investments made last Congress to increase capacity at our Federal permitting offices were a downpayment, but we need to continue to invest in agency capability. Again, this amendment simply makes sure that our local agencies are thinking about communicating with our local talent when trying to fill those hiring challenges. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I rise today in support of my amendment, which is imperative to bringing home an essential supply chain and protecting our national security, all while protecting the environment. Rare earth elements and critical minerals are essential components in the daily lives of Americans, as well as in national security technology from home computers, televisions, and vehicles, to major weapons systems, including lasers, guided missile systems, jet engines, and alloys for armored vehicles. Currently, China controls the bulk of the global supply of these critical minerals and rare earths that support America's economy and defense industrial base. The demand for these minerals will steadily increase as the global economy adopts new technologies, placing the United States and its allies at a growing disadvantage unless steps are taken to shift production and sourcing away from Chinese Communist Party-controlled entities. The risk of supply disruptions is amplified by U.S. dependence on unreliable foreign sources and red tape that disincentivizes domestic sourcing. It is estimated that 80 percent of rare earth minerals in the United States come from China. For too long, bureaucratic red tape and uncertainty in the permitting process forced critical mineral and rare earth operations overseas. This amendment works to jump-start American critical mineral, rare- earth element, and carbon production to make our supply chains more resilient while creating opportunities for coal and coal byproducts to be used in new, clean, and innovative ways. According to Bureau of Land Management estimates, there are nearly 5,200 coal-related abandoned mine sites that have yet to be fully reclaimed. Through this amendment, we are creating an avenue for rare earths to be extracted from coal waste at these abandoned mine sites. This would not only help the United States with this critical supply chain need but also address our Nation's environmental and reclamation needs. Specifically, this amendment would include projects related to extraction, recovery, or processing of critical minerals, rare earth elements, or carbon from coal, coal waste, coal processing waste, or pre- or post-combustion coal byproducts, or acid mine drainage from coal mines as covered projects eligible for FAST-41 permitting for the purposes of securing the economic and national security of the United States. Mr. Speaker, whether you are like me, a member of the Congressional Coal Caucus or a member of the Sustainable Energy Caucus or a national security hawk or a member of the Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, every Member of Congress should be for this win-win-win solution, a win to reclaim these abandoned mine sites and fix an environmental problem, a win for the coal industry and the workers in the coal industry who need alternatives to combustion of coal now that we are in the transition phase of our energy development in our country, and certainly a win for national security. This is a way for us to end overdependence on the Chinese Communist Party for critical, national security sensitive supply chain needs. The United States must innovate and secure its supply chain of sensitive strategic materials in order to reduce reliance on Chinese Communist Party-controlled materials overseas. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``aye'' on my amendment, which I expect to be fully bipartisan, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I rise in support of the amendment. During our markup of this bill in the committee, Representative Gosar offered a similar amendment to this one, though it applied only to oil and gas, not mining. I asked if he would consider adding mining to that ban, but that was declined. I also had an amendment to this bill to include mining in this ban, which was not made in order. However, this Republican amendment, which is very similar to my own, was made in order. I am glad to see that at least some Republicans have come around to the point of including mining as part of the ban. If we don't want the Chinese Communist Party developing oil and gas leases on Federal land and water, then we shouldn't be supportive of the CCP mining our publicly owned minerals. It isn't hard to find that many foreign-owned parent companies have terrible records of human rights abuses, environmental degradation, harming indigenous communities, and destroying sacred sites. Some foreign companies, specifically several owned by the Government of China, are known to have horrible records on all of these fronts, yet they can operate freely on our Federal land, including in my home State of Arizona, through their subsidiaries. I have repeatedly heard from my colleagues that we agree that human rights and environmental abuses are wrong, but so far, they have refused to address the problem. As the demand for these minerals increases, let's not rush to open our lands to just anyone who wants to mine. Let's take a closer look at who is operating on our Federal lands and work to raise the global standard. Let me remind Members that under our outdated 150-year-old mining law, mining claimants do not pay a cent, not one penny, for the public's valuable resources that they extract and turn around and sell--nothing. That is a better deal than even oil and gas get. We absolutely should not be handing our public mineral resources over to the CCP with no fair return to the American people, no return to the American people at all, where the result would be simply just to destroy our lands. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

Most folks at home have never even heard of the Delaware River Basin Commission. They don't even know about interstate compacts. Here is what they know: They want to live their lives, and they want to vote for elected officials to make decisions that are important to them. If it is so dangerous, how come it is banned here but not there? In the rest of Pennsylvania, we do it. Mr. Speaker, this is just taking the people's rights away, their voices away from their elected officials, and it is literally the definition of tyranny. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "The Governors are the four commissioners. The Governor of Pennsylvania is the chairman of the commission. They may delegate to someone to actually go to the meetings, but they are making these decisions. I don't understand how my colleagues on the other side of the aisle think that we should take away the rights of the Governors who are on these commissions to make the decision that was a 4-0 decision. If they decide that they want something different in the Delaware watershed than in their individual States, that is their prerogative, but they made this decision. They voted 4-0. Again, I don't see the point, and I think it is really egregious for us to take away the powers of the Governors, as they are elected by the people of the four States to make this decision about fracking within their watershed. Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "the Delaware River Basin Commission is made up of representatives from the States of New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and my home State of New Jersey. The commission oversees drinking water quality for the Delaware River Watershed, a vitally important role that impacts millions of people across four States. Congress created the commission over 60 years ago and gave it powers to regulate the Delaware River Watershed. Crucially, each State's democratically elected leaders signed up to join the commission, and each State receives a vote on the commission. Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, the commission banned fracking in its watershed, and this wasn't a controversial decision. In fact, it was unanimous. It was a 4-0 vote to help protect the public health of the 13 million citizens in the watershed and to preserve the waters themselves. Today, Republicans want to retroactively take away the rights of the citizens of these four States and their elected representatives. They want to take away the powers that Congress gave the commission just because they don't like the outcome. I would suggest this: If you really care about clean rivers and waters, I urge you to oppose this amendment. If you care about people's rights to safe drinking water, I urge you to oppose this amendment. I would like to think that all my colleagues care about these things, so I urge opposition to the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time."

              "I thank the chairman for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, this administration's regulatory assault on American energy production has been devastating for my constituents in the Central Valley. Every week, I hear from my neighbors, friends, and constituents about the skyrocketing price of monthly energy bills. Over the summer, people in California were paying over $6 per gallon for gas. It is unacceptable that even though America has some of the greatest energy resources of any nation in the world, my constituents are having trouble putting gas in their tanks and food on their tables. That is why I am proud to support the Lower Energy Costs Act, and I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same. This bill will cut red tape and allow us to increase our supply of safe, clean, and affordable energy. I am proud that language from my bill, the NEPA Adequacy Streamlining Act, is included in this bill. This makes the approval of new energy projects easier by allowing the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to use previously conducted environmental assessments for similar projects. This is a commonsense reform that removes one of the many layers of bureaucratic red tape in our permitting process. This bill is full of the same types of policies that streamline our energy production to increase our supply of clean, affordable energy. I want to respond to some of the opponents of this bill. My Democratic colleagues claim that this legislation is harmful to our environment. This is just not true. America has some of the strictest environmental standards of any nation in the world. When we produce energy here, we do it cleaner and safer than countries we would be importing it from. Something important to remember is that decreasing domestic production does not reduce the demand for energy. Reducing our ability to produce oil and gas in the U.S. just increases our reliance on foreign countries for these imports. That means instead of using clean energy we produce here and creating good-paying American jobs in the process, we are reliant on imports from countries like Russia and Venezuela that are not held to the same environmental standards we have here in the U.S. If your argument is that you want to reduce emissions, then increasing U.S. energy production is how you do it. Despite wishes from the President and the far left, we cannot abandon traditional energy sources like oil and gas. While we as a country should continue to develop and pursue other energy sources, we will still need oil and gas for a long time. Why not produce it here in the U.S.? I support an all-of-the-above approach to energy production and use, but that does not mean immediately transitioning to 100 percent renewable fuels. Until alternative energy sources are more reliable, we will continue to need transitional fuels. If my Democratic colleagues cared about the environment as much as they say they do, then supporting the increased production of clean and reliable American-made energy should be a no-brainer. Passing the Lower Energy Costs Act is a critical step to lowering prices, creating good-paying jobs, and strengthening our national security. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill.",
              "everything around us that makes our lives possible is either mined, or it is grown. Everything. Above the Speaker's chair is a plea from Daniel Webster to those who serve in this House. ``Let us develope the resources of our land, call forth its powers . . . and see whether we also, in our day and generation may not perform something worthy to be remembered.'' Yet, for 50 years, the environmental left has slowly strangled our Nation's ability to do just that. In the process, it is impoverishing the American people. One of its most powerful weapons is the National Environmental Policy Act imposed in 1969 with the promise that it would protect the environment. It has done exactly the opposite. It has made it endlessly time consuming and ultimately cost prohibitive to manage our forests, to provide abundant water for our people, and to prosper from our vast energy and mineral resources. My district comprises the forests of the Sierra Nevada and the agricultural heartland of California's Central Valley. The left promised us that NEPA would protect our forests and water resources. Come to my district, and you will see what a cruel and demonstrable lie that has become. Excess timber is removed from our forests in only two ways. If we don't carry it out, nature will burn it out. Throughout the 20th century, the U.S. Forest Service marked off surplus timber and auctioned it to logging companies that paid us to remove it. The result was healthy, resilient, and fire-resistant Federal forests, a steady revenue source for forest improvements, and thriving mountain economies. Then came the National Environmental Policy Act. Simple forest thinning projects now require an average of 4\\1/2\\ years of environmental studies, costing millions of dollars, more than the value of the timber. Instead of making money for the government, removing excess timber now costs us money. As a result, our forests have become morbidly overgrown, carrying four times the timber that the land can support. In that stressed condition, the trees succumb to disease, pestilence, drought, and ultimately catastrophic wildfires we haven't seen in over a century. California is one of the most water-rich regions of the country. Yet, the farms of the Central Valley have had their water systematically choked off because NEPA and other environmental laws make major new reservoirs all but impossible to build. Record rainfall this year is being lost to the ocean simply because we have no place to store it. When the little town of Foresthill tried to add a $2 million spillway gate for additional water storage, they discovered that because of NEPA, they also had to budget an additional $1 million for environmental reviews and $2 million for environmental mitigation. After more than a decade, the project has yet to be built. The last reservoir over a million acre-feet constructed in California was completed in 1979. Meanwhile, the State's population has nearly doubled. Mr. Speaker, when something is plentiful, it is cheap. When it is scarce, it is expensive. NEPA is making everything we depend upon in our lives increasingly scarce, and therefore, increasingly expensive. The left obsesses over a 1-degree rise in temperature over the next century, but they couldn't care less that they are making it impossible for people to heat their homes in subfreezing winters. They promise us they care about the environment, but they couldn't care less that entire human communities' and species' habitats and millions of acres of forest are being laid to waste by preventable mega fires. They obsess over the snail darter but couldn't care less that they have destroyed thousands of agricultural jobs, idled a half million acres of California farmland, and sent grocery prices skyrocketing. They promised us that NEPA would protect our forests. Instead, it is destroying them. H.R. 1 begins to dial back the damage that NEPA has done, both to the environment and to the quality of life of all Americans, simply by reducing the time and cost required for these massive bureaucratic studies. The question before us is whether our children will grow up in a world of scarcity, poverty, and misery or one of abundance, prosperity, and optimism. That is the simple question before us. We choose prosperity; a future of abundant and affordable energy, water, food, lumber, minerals, and all the material comforts and benefits that flow from the resources our country has been blessed with. That is something worthy to be remembered, and that future can begin with this vote today.",
              "I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1. As one of the few Members who serves on both the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Natural Resources, I have seen almost every version of this package as it was crafted. Hearing after hearing and markup after markup, it has been clear. I love my Republican colleagues, but they are more focused on advancing partisan bills that will benefit the oil, gas, and mining industries while selling out landmark environmental laws in the name of permitting reform, instead of advancing meaningful, bipartisan solutions for the American people that will help us achieve our climate goals and solidify our energy security for future generations. For months now, my Republican colleagues have called for policies and permitting reforms in Congress that would strengthen our energy security. I have consistently been willing to work with my colleagues-- and still want to--in this pursuit, but what we have here is not reform. Gutting the National Environmental Policy Act, otherwise known as NEPA, is not permitting reform. Weakening enforcement under the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and other critical public health laws is not permitting reform. Granting mining companies the ability to take minerals from public lands without paying a dime to taxpayers in royalties or helping clean up these toxic sites afterward is not permitting reform. Forcing Federal agencies to hold oil and gas sales on public lands, even if they are not needed, is not permitting reform. Repealing the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27 billion program, that I admit I helped author, to deploy clean energy projects nationwide and cut greenhouse gas pollution, is not permitting reform and will not strengthen our energy security in any meaningful way. To my Republican colleagues who continue to refuse to believe the science or to acknowledge we are facing an existential threat from the climate crisis, just read the United Nation's most recent IPCC report from 2022. This legislation instead puts polluters, profits, and pollution over the American people. It is that simple. In order to truly attain meaningful energy independence here at home, we need a net zero energy economy built on solar, wind, hydropower, batteries, electric vehicles, and even nuclear. What we cannot do is expect more drilling for oil and gas to solve all of our current and future energy woes. I do understand bad weather. The last four weekends, I have had snow and ice, and I have lost my electricity every single weekend. Listen, we are at the beginning of a transformational shift toward a clean energy economy, a shift that has now accelerated due to the historic investments and legislation Democrats and the Biden-Harris administration were able to enact into law over the last 2 years. This transition will likely present the greatest permitting challenge in generations. However, we must permit and build in ways that do not harm communities or our environment. That is why Democrats enacted historic legislation last Congress, the Inflation Reduction Act, that directed over a billion-dollar investment to increase staffing and resources across Federal agencies for conducting efficient and effective environmental reviews and permitting. The bill today doesn't have real solutions to high energy costs, and it is going to drive up the deficit, not according to Democrats, but according to the independent Congressional Budget Office. I am pragmatic and I am seasoned enough to know we have a lot of work ahead. If we can do it collectively, Republicans and Democrats, it can serve as an important tool to combat climate change, strengthen our economy, and protect our national security. But again, let me be clear: We must not entertain proposals that roll back landmark environmental laws across the board, including NEPA, so we can line the pockets of Big Oil. As I mentioned at committee, when John Dingell and Senator ``Scoop'' Jackson originally authored and advanced the National Environmental Policy Act, it was done thoughtfully, through a meaningful legislative process, to build broad and bipartisan support. This is the process that we need. We can't gut NEPA. It was brought about to include community and to care about the economy. We have got to work together. I remain open to working with my Republican colleagues on bipartisan energy security and permitting reform efforts. I hope we can. My colleague, the chairman, knows I want to, but I still do not see this legislative package as a serious proposal. I don't want to be dependent on China more than anybody else does for our batteries, or Russia or any other country. We need to do it in the good ol' USA. We can do it with ingenuity, innovation, technology, and protect our environment at the same time. Mr. Speaker, I am strongly opposed, and I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill."

              "I rise in opposition to the amendment. But in response to the ranking member, I just want to underscore that H.R. 21 is designed to stop the abuse of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for nonemergency political reasons such as President Biden's decision to drain the SPR in the days leading up to the election. So the other side likes to say: Well, it was the war in Ukraine that caused the prices to go up. The war in Ukraine just exposed the energy crisis that started on day one of the Biden administration. Mr. Speaker, on day one of the Biden administration, gas prices were $2.33 a gallon, and they have just continued to go up, jeopardizing reliability and affordability, as well as our national security. My concern with the gentlewoman's amendment is that the SPR is one of America's most important energy security tools, and we cannot tie the hands of the President regardless of which party is in office when we have a real emergency like a hurricane, a terrorist attack, or something that disrupts our oil supply. The underlying bill, H.R. 21, is focused on protecting SPR from President Biden's abuse of it. H.R. 21 should be a bipartisan bill. It should be a bipartisan bill. Just a couple of weeks ago, we passed H.R. 22, Protecting America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve From China Act which gained the support of my Democrat colleagues--over 100 Democratic colleagues voting with us to ban exports of SPR to China. Let's keep the momentum going. Let's send the Senate and the President a very strong, bipartisan bill. Representative Greene is right that President Biden has abused our strategic stockpile, and he has failed to put forward a plan to increase domestic energy supply. Let's pass the underlying bill and get back to work. Mr. Speaker, I urge ``no'' on the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I thank Chairwoman Rodgers for yielding me time. I rise in support of H.R. 21, an important and timely bill, and I am proud that the new Republican majority made this one of our first priorities. In less than 2 years, President Biden has drained our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, putting American energy security at risk. Thankfully, House Republicans have a plan to address the issue, replenish our reserve, and unleash American energy. The President's energy policies have hurt Americans, and I thank my colleague on the other side of the aisle. He is correct. In releasing oil from the SPR, it may have helped to lower gasoline prices; however, it uncloaked the lie that it was price gouging from oil companies that caused prices to rise to begin with. More supply was needed, that was obvious, and this administration's policies had constrained domestic production and supply. Approximately 40 percent of the SPR has been drawn down since President Biden took office, with no plan to replenish it. Instead of working together to address the issue, the President has, indeed, chosen to peddle a false narrative about our efforts. The President claims our bill, the Strategic Production Response Act, would limit the administration's access to the SPR. This is blatantly false. Our bill specifically reinforces a President's ability to tap the SPR if an energy emergency is declared. Our bill would, however, require the Department of Energy to prepare a plan to encourage domestic production if the SPR is tapped without a declared energy emergency. While we may accept the seriousness of climate change, we do not accept that U.S. energy transmission and restructuring of the entire industrial base is the solution. Energy security is national security, and failing to increase energy production and replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve puts our country at risk. We need to unleash American innovation and energy production and set our country on a path to energy independence. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 21.",
              "in that letter, Secretary Granholm wrote that by hamstringing the administration, this bill will result in ``more oil supply shortages in times of crisis and higher gasoline prices for Americans.'' The President also recognizes this bill is a bad deal for the American people, and that is why he said that he would veto it if it ever got to his desk. Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record the text of the Statement of Administration Policy. Statement of Administration Policy H.R. 21--Strategic Production Response Act--Rep. McMorris Rodgers, R-WA and 31 Cosponsors The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 21, the Strategic Production Response Act. The bill would significantly weaken a critical energy security tool, resulting in more oil supply shortages and higher gas prices for working families. This Administration's use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has been essential to protecting our energy security and to lowering gas prices for Americans. Following Putin's further invasion of Ukraine last year, President Biden authorized the largest-ever emergency release from the SPR, in coordination with historic releases from allies and partners. The results speak for themselves: today, gasoline prices are $1.60 per gallon lower than their peak this summer and below their pre-invasion levels. That was far from a foregone conclusion: the Treasury Department estimates that SPR actions reduced prices at the pump by as much as 40 cents per gallon. If enacted, H.R. 21 would significantly weaken America's ability to take such decisive action to increase supply and lower prices in times of crisis. Putin has tried to use energy supply and high prices as a strategy to weaken the United States and Europe's resolve to defend Ukraine. By interfering with the United States' ability to release, oil collectively, this legislation would help Putin's war aims. In addition, H.R. 21 would severely restrict the Administration's ability to increase oil supply and prevent price spikes in response to natural disasters or pipeline outages-as Administrations of both parties have done. By arbitrarily requiring completion of a report related to energy production on Federal lands, H.R. 21 makes it harder to provide relief to Americans during energy disruptions globally and at home. Moreover, there is nothing currently standing in the way of domestic oil production. Production is up by more than 1 million barrels per day under President Biden and is on track to reach a new record this year. Oil and gas companies are currently sitting on thousands of unused but approved permits that they can use to further increase production right now. Because H.R. 21 will jeopardize our energy security and increase gas prices for working families, the Administration strongly opposes the bill. If Congress were to pass this bill, the President would veto it."

              "I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 21. A poll was released today that 73 percent of Americans think that the Republican leadership has the wrong priorities, and today we consider a bill which demonstrates how true those poll results are. With this bill, the Republicans are giving a big, wet kiss to Big Oil. They are making it more difficult for families to afford gas at the pump and rewarding Big Oil with record profits. Once again, they are demonstrating they care more about protecting the profits of Big Oil than protecting the wallets of hardworking Americans. This legislation would make it impossible--or nearly impossible--for the President to lower gas prices by tying releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to this notion of expanding leasing on Federal lands, which would make it almost impossible, as Mrs. Fletcher explained just moments ago. Linking releases from the reserve to increases in drilling on Federal lands will result in higher prices for Americans and an exacerbation of the climate crisis already facing our country. What is more startling is this isn't even necessary. There are over 9,000 leases available right now where drilling is not taking place. Why? Because Big Oil wants to keep the price up high to maximize their profits and continue to gouge the American consumers. Let's not continue to help them to do that. The President was very wise to strategically use that reserve to lower the price at the pump. I urge all my colleagues not to embrace this crazy idea of protecting the profits for Big Oil, gouging our constituents with higher gas prices, worsening the climate crisis, and instead, focus on the priorities of the American people to lower the cost of goods, to lower the cost of gas at the pump, to lower the cost of food at the grocery store. That is what Republicans ran on, Mr. Speaker, and their first act was to gut the IRS to make it harder for people to get their tax returns back, and today they are trying to protect Big Oil and make it more expensive for our constituents. Vote ``no.''",
              "again, I don't know how to characterize this but to say it is extreme. The gentlewoman's amendment would provide an even bigger handout to Big Oil, trading away our precious Federal lands. Now, just so we understand, right now, there is a limitation in the underlying bill which, of course, we still oppose because the underlying bill says that the plan--in other words, I think we all know that this underlying bill says: You can't use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve unless you open up more Federal or public lands to oil and gas drillings. But it does have a cap that says the plan required shall not provide for a total increase in the percentage of Federal lands described, lease for oil and gas, in excess of 10 percent. Let me just give you an idea. In the underlying bill, it could result in over 300 million acres of Federal lands being opened up for new oil and gas drilling, an area equivalent to three times the size of California and eight times the amount of Federal lands and waters currently available for oil and gas development. But the gentlewoman from Colorado says that is not good enough. The government has to allow for another 5 percent beyond that, another 50 percent more than what I described in order for us to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Again, the fossil fuel industry already controls large portions of U.S. public lands and waters, and it isn't using most of it. Right now, the fossil fuel industry is sitting on approximately 9,000 approved but unused permits for drilling on public lands. In total, the fossil fuel industry controls over 26 million acres of U.S. onshore public lands, half of which is going unused. Offshore, the fossil fuel industry has over 2,000 active leases, covering 12 million acres of Federal water, 75 percent of which is not being used to produce oil or gas. So the gentlewoman says that she wants clean air and clean water. Well, the consequence of this would be just the opposite. We would be polluting the air and probably polluting the water as well, so it makes absolutely no sense. I mean, right now, there is nothing to stand in the way of production, which is up 1 million barrels a day under President Biden, not to mention oil and gas companies are sitting on billions of dollars. They are making huge profits. The oil and gas companies don't want to produce more oil here in the United States because that would lower the price. They are about profits. They are about raising the price of gasoline at the pump. By using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, President Biden has reduced the price at the pump. So what the gentlewoman is proposing is extreme because this even allows more public lands to be leased, or require it, that is not going to be pumped anyway because the oil companies don't want it, and at the same time, prohibit this administration from actually helping the American consumer by lowering prices. It is extreme. Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to oppose it, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment requires oil and gas companies operating on our public lands to make one simple pledge to the American people, that it won't gouge consumers at the pump. It requires the Secretary of Energy to secure that commitment before any new permit to increase production on our lands will be approved. It would help prevent some of the damage that this disastrous bill would do to our Nation's ability to address skyrocketing energy prices in the country. Frankly, the bill before us is nothing more than a shameless attempt by my Republican colleagues to help increase drilling. If this bill were titled correctly, it would be known as the big win for Big Oil act, and it would come at a huge price for the American people. As the chair of the Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee in the last Congress, I have been on the front lines to bring down gas prices in this country. I held a hearing last year with the top executives from six of the Nation's largest oil producers to have them explain why Americans were suddenly being asked to pay record-high prices at the pump and why Americans should be forced to provide their companies billions of dollars in subsidies each year when they were reporting record-high profits and hardworking families were struggling hard to fill up their cars. Despite what the supporters of this bill will tell you, not one executive at that hearing claimed that opening up Federal land for drilling would lower prices at the pump. In fact, one executive at that hearing even admitted that opening up more land to drilling in the country would do nothing to bring the cost of gasoline down. Why? Because there is nothing--and I repeat, nothing--preventing the oil industry from expanding its production tomorrow if they wanted to. They just choose not to because of profits. The oil industry currently leases 26.6 million acres of Federal lands. Less than half of that land under current lease, 12.7 acres, is currently being used for production, so there is no relationship between opening up more Federal lands for the production of oil and gas and the price that Americans pay at the pump. None. Instead of helping to bring down prices for consumers, what this bill does is it really makes it harder for future administrations to respond. It takes away the one tool that has been used effectively to help alleviate the pain consumers were suddenly feeling this past summer and the one tool we have to prevent it from happening again. It prevents the President from releasing our Nation's oil reserves on to the market during a crisis. It prevents the administration from taking the steps necessary to curb excessive price increases that can cause real harm to people, family, and businesses across this country. If Republicans were serious about helping consumers, let's do it, but let's do it explicitly. Let's include in this bill a provision that will expressly prohibit these companies from gouging consumers at the pump. My amendment requires the Secretary of Energy to secure from any oil company looking to increase production on Federal lands a commitment that it will not excessively increase its prices during periods of future disruption. It gives the oil companies what the Republicans say the industry wants, which is the ability to increase production on the public lands. So all we ask for--all we ask for--Mr. Speaker, is a simple commitment that they won't gouge consumers at the pump. Sounds like a win-win to me. I would urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment to the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Point of Order"

              "I listened to the gentlewoman from Georgia, and to me, this amendment is unbelievable. I mean, she says that you can't draw down or sell petroleum products under this amendment for political and nonemergency purposes. Well, I mean, everything around here is political, so I don't know how you would define that. What the President has been doing is using this Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help bring down the price of gasoline at the pump, or in other cases, to increase supply because of the supply shortage due to Russia's action in the invasion of Ukraine. These are, in my opinion, totally legitimate emergency purposes to help the American people and help the supply chain. What the bill does is to say: Well, if you want to do that--if you want to use the reserve--then you have to drill for more oil on public lands. Well, isn't that political. A decision is made to say that you can't use the reserve unless you help the oil companies and let the oil companies take more of our public lands. That is about the most political thing that I can think of. In addition to that, was it not political when the Republican administrations in the past released and sold oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve? What did they do it for. Well, they did it for deficit reduction. They did it to pay for different items, like the 21st Century Cures bill that came out of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Were those emergencies? Were those not political? I would argue that using the reserve for those purposes was not an emergency at all and certainly was incredibly political. This is just another example of what the Republicans are doing. They are politicizing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because they want to make message points. They know that this bill isn't going anywhere. The President already said that he will veto it, and the Senate won't take it up. They are being so political. They are talking about situations that have nothing to do with an emergency. I really don't know what to say. The whole process here is very political, oriented toward messaging, oriented toward going on TV, I guess, to appeal to base voters. It is just incredible to me that this amendment is being offered. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "before I discuss the details of my amendment, I want to applaud the new Republican majority for giving Members the opportunity to offer amendments in a more open process. The people's House has been broken for far too long, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in an open process for the remainder of this Congress. I also want to thank Chairwoman McMorris-Rodgers for her leadership on this issue to put American energy first. I cosponsored this legislation because I believe it puts America back on track to regain energy independence. This is such an important issue and critical piece of legislation that I believe we cannot stop short. We need to chart a path back to energy independence and ensure President Biden is not able to sell our critical oil supplies to China or any other rogue nation. President Biden used emergency authorities to sell hundreds of millions of barrels of oil to our enemies. My amendment would prevent President Biden from claiming an emergency to further reduce our strategic oil supplies. This is why I filed impeachment articles last Congress against President Biden on the grounds that he endangered, compromised, and undermined the energy security of the United States by selling oil from the United States' Strategic Petroleum Reserve to foreign nations. President Biden has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to the national security of our country. No President in the history of the United States has ordered a liquidation of the SPR on this scale. He sold 40 percent of our critical oil supply to trick and deceive the American people before the election. Rather than unleashing American energy here at home, he has robbed our country. When President Biden took office in 2021, the SPR contained 638 million barrels of oil. Since then, he has slashed our oil inventory to 371 million barrels. He has decimated the SPR to the lowest level since December, 1983, before some Members of this body were even born. He shredded the offers from oil companies to resupply the reserve. He gave away 7 million barrels of our oil to a Communist Chinese state-run energy firm. The CCP had 1.2 billion barrels when Biden took office, they have even more now. I cannot believe our President did that. If we let President Biden continue to run our oil this way, we will have nothing left. This has destroyed America's oil production. President Biden shut down the Keystone XL pipeline, destroying hundreds of thousands of American jobs. President Biden has allowed the least amount of federal land for drilling since the end of World War II. We are now producing 1 million barrels of oil less every day compared to when President Trump was in office. Every country faces natural disasters. Where will we get our oil next time we are in crisis? Whom will we have to beg to get our oil? China? Iran? The Saudis? Venezuela--like the Biden administration has already done? Or maybe even Russia? President Biden's actions prove an intentional plot to destroy America's oil industry and usher in the climate cult's Green New Deal. My amendment would simply strike the exceptions that Biden used to sell our oil. The American people don't believe that the President should have the authority to declare an emergency for any reason and then sell our oil to our enemies. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I can only characterize this amendment as extreme. If adopted, this amendment would make an already reckless bill even more careless and would weaken our national energy security. Now, let me say that I totally disagree with what the gentlewoman just said. First of all, what President Biden has done, as we have said repeatedly today, is to release crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to bring down gas prices. And he actually accomplished that goal. It worked by bringing down prices about a $1.50 per gallon since the peak last June. In addition to that, we have set forth that this was to address the supply chain because we know that with the war in Ukraine, the supply chain was severely limited, and one of the purposes of releasing oil from the reserve was to have more in the supply chain. The gentlewoman also suggested that this administration is restricting the use of public lands for drilling. That is simply not the case. One-half of the public lands are available for drilling. As I have said before, the oil companies simply don't want to drill because they want to keep the prices artificially high. Now, what the gentlewoman has done--and I just want to explain this in a little detail. Right now, the bill before us does have an exemption that says that you don't have to drill or put forth a plan to drill on public lands if certain criteria are met. It says that during a severe energy supply interruption, if the President determines that an emergency situation exists and there is a significant reduction in supply, a severe increase in the price of petroleum products and/or such price increase is likely to cause a major adverse impact on the national economy. So even under this underlying bill, if those criteria are met, then the President can use the SPR and release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for these reasons. What the gentlewoman has done--or tries to do--in this amendment is eliminate those exemptions. So essentially what she is saying--this is why this is so extreme--is she is saying it doesn't matter if there is a problem with high prices. It doesn't matter if there is a problem with the supply chain. We are not going to let the President release oil from the reserve for any reason whatsoever unless a plan is put forward to allow for more drilling on public lands. That is extreme. Even the Republican leadership doesn't support that. She is saying no exemptions whatsoever. Imagine what this would do if we had no flexibility whatsoever no matter what the price was, no matter what the supply was, and no matter what the emergency is, not allowed. You have got to put together a plan which could take years to put forward a way of drilling more on public lands before we would be able to use this tool which is so important for national security. This is really, in my opinion, outrageous and extreme. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to oppose the amendment for this reason, and I yield back the balance of my time."

              "I rise in strong opposition to the gentlewoman's amendment which would expose historic ranching lands in Colorado to oil and gas extraction, extraction the community simply does not want. Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill we are considering today makes clear that some in this Chamber want to see our public lands, lands owned by all Americans, open to extensive new oil and gas extraction. As we have already heard, the bill risks opening an area more than three times the size of California to new oil and gas development; and this, despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of Americans, including more than two-thirds of western voters, consistently say that they would prefer to see public lands protected rather than opened to new degradation. Protecting these lands supports the climate, outdoor recreation, and local economies. In the case of this particular amendment, the community in Thompson Divide has already been fighting for more than two decades to protect this area from new oil and gas drilling. Since the early 2000s, the local community, including ranchers, farmers, sportsmen, businesspeople, and community leaders, worked together to fight for intact forests, big game and endangered species habitat, and the region's ranching history. Now the people of Thompson Divide have also opposed extraction because they have seen its effects firsthand. They have seen how companies more concerned with profit than public health polluted their streams, leaking toxic chemicals into the groundwater. The gentlewoman from Colorado, in the previous amendment, said that she wanted clean air and clean water, but that is not the case. That is not what is going to happen here with this amendment. To stem these impacts, Democratic Members, including my good friend and public lands defender, Representative Joe Neguse, has long championed protections for the Thompson Divide. Because of these longstanding efforts from the community and those who represented them, just last year, President Biden took action to protect this landscape from new extraction for the next 20 years. His decision to protect the Thompson Divide was cheered by citizens across the State of Colorado as an essential protection for an irreplaceable landscape. This amendment before us would reverse these protections, exposing this community again to poisoned wells and degraded forests. It goes against the interests of the Thompson Divide community, against the interests of Coloradans, and against the interests of the American people. So I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment would block this legislation from allowing increased oil and gas leasing on any Federal land where outdoor recreation takes place. Our public lands are for the public, not for the wealthiest industry in the history of the world to drill and to spoil with impunity. Being active in the outdoors and experiencing wild places is a way of life not just in my district but for many communities around this country. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when we were unable to gather the way we liked to indoors, we learned just how important our parks and our public lands are, how getting outside helps our well-being. This is why we must protect and expand our public lands for recreational use, not give them away to a single polluting industry. We all depend on the ecological, economic, and mental health benefits that our public lands provide. That is why my amendment protects these important lands. If we are good stewards, our public lands can simultaneously support a thriving outdoor recreation economy as well as natural resiliency against the climate crisis, all while preserving and protecting these precious lands for future generations. These are the goals of the Biden administration and the State of California in their efforts to protect 30 percent of our lands by 2030 because these lands are meant for everyone to use, enjoy, and pass down to future generations to do the same. However, H.R. 21 would create an arbitrary increase in oil and gas development for the benefit of one single group: the oil and gas industry. This bill may seem simple--it is just three pages long--yet it does something really big and dangerous. It stands to open up over 300 million acres to be destroyed for oil and gas drilling, an area equivalent to three times the size of California or six times the combined size of all our national parks. This is unacceptable, and it is another example of the dangerous extremism we see from this new Republican majority. The fact of the matter is, there are currently 9,000 permits held by the oil and gas industry right now that are not being used. Additionally, the majority of the roughly 26 million acres that are currently under lease to oil and gas companies on our Federal lands and waters are not being used. Industry is simply sitting on them to keep prices artificially high. What would industry do with the dramatic expansion of new leasing opportunities on our valuable public lands? Well, the evidence shows that they will simply lock them up so that they couldn't be used for other activities such as recreation or renewable energy. I represent the north coast of California, and my constituents know the value of public lands for outdoor recreation, from hiking and climbing to kayaking and angling. I hope folks on both sides of the aisle agree that we need to protect the future of these cherished recreational activities on our public lands. Our public lands used for outdoor recreation should not be sacrificed at the altar of Big Oil. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 21, which would prevent increased drilling on Federal lands under this act until the Secretary of Energy certifies that it would not perpetrate environmental injustice. Let me just thank, first of all, Ranking Member Pallone for his leadership and support in advancing this amendment. My amendment is very simple. It prohibits increases in the percentage of Federal lands leased for oil and gas production under this act, if that new drilling would perpetuate environmental injustice. Environmental justice is the right to a safe, healthy, productive, and sustainable environment for all, regardless of race, class, income, or background. For too long, we have overlooked the impact of environmental issues on underserved communities in this country. EPA data shows that people of color are much more likely to live near polluters and breathe polluted air. For instance, asthma, which is often caused by a particular pollution, impacts approximately 13.4 percent of African- American children, compared to only 7.3 percent of White children. But all low-income people and communities, and especially in poor communities, all communities deserve to be safe from environmental health impacts, and people of all races confront environmental injustice. Rural communities are also adversely impacted by mining pollution and contaminated air and groundwater. Environmental injustices impact all of us; from urban centers to rural regions. In my home State of California, we are experiencing the climate emergency firsthand. We know that these unprecedented fires are driven by climate change. Preventing harmful oil and gas drilling, especially when it harms those already most vulnerable, will help get us back on the path to justice. This amendment builds off of the A. Donald McEachin, our beloved late colleague, his Environmental Justice for All Act, that I am proud to co-lead with Ranking Member Grijalva, which sets the stage to begin addressing the long history of environmental racism and injustice in the United States. Mr. Speaker, this fight for environmental justice is also very personal for me. I was born and raised in El Paso, Texas, under the shadow of the smokestacks of the Asarco copper smelter. Myself, my friends, my neighbors, we were constantly exposed to toxic chemicals. I watched so many people close to me, including family members, suffer with major health challenges because of lead that spewed from that plant. In the 1970s, the CDC found that 62 percent of children under 10 living near the plant where I lived had toxic levels of lead in their blood. Even after the smelter was shut down, I think it was, like, 2013, it took decades before any of the residents harmed saw any sort of justice. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article titled: ``Before Flint, Before East Chicago, There Was Smeltertown.'' [From NRDC, Nov. 29, 2016] Before Flint, Before East Chicago, There Was Smeltertown (By Lauren Villagran) After a 1970s CDC study showed that the mostly Mexican- American population of this Texas town had dangerously high blood lead levels, its buildings were demolished and its residents were booted. The Smelter Cemetery sits high atop a desert arroyo between Interstate 10 and the Mexican border in El Paso. Its wind- worn wooden crosses are almost all that remain of a community that sprang up more than a century ago next to an Asarco lead smelter on the banks of the Rio Grande. The stone-pile graves bear testament to the history of this place called Smeltertown. At one time it was a village of more than 2,500 people, most of them Mexican immigrants who built their lives on company land in the shadow of the smelter's smokestacks that would poison their air, their land, and their children. And almost as soon as the contamination became known in the 1970s, the community of Smeltertown was erased: its buildings demolished, its people forced out. Now, the men and women who lived and worked in Smeltertown, their children, and their children's children reunite each year. Many still live in El Paso, in neighborhoods that cropped up as Smeltertown was torn down. Others travel from California, the East Coast, and abroad. They come together to reweave the social fabric of Smeltertown by sharing memories and retelling stories they all know by heart. They celebrate their old hometown despite the dangers it posed to their families. Seminal research done on Smeltertown in the 1970s by the Centers for Disease Control found that 62 percent of children 10 and under living within one mile of the smelter had blood lead levels considered to be ``evidence of undue lead absorption.'' The residents of Smeltertown would be the first American community to face the grim prospect of lead exposure and its consequences--but they wouldn't be the last. The communities of Flint, Michigan, the West Calumet Housing Complex in East Chicago, Indiana, and the schools in Newark, New Jersey, are just three of the most recent examples. But the CDC estimates that at least half a million children in the United States have elevated blood lead levels--and many of them may not even know it. A Company Town The American Smelting and Refining Company owned a smelter in El Paso that, starting in 1910, refined hundreds of thousands of tons of lead and copper harvested from its mines in Mexico. It did so with the help of ``an army of Mexican contract workers,'' according to University of Houston associate professor of history Monica Perales in her book Smeltertown: Making and Remembering a Southwest Border Community. Mexican workers who labored in Asarco mines began migrating north, lured by that new operation on the U.S. side of the border. Many settled on company land below the foothills of Mt. Cristo Rey. In the early years of the 20th century, Smeltertown lay outside El Paso city limits, a few miles from the city's downtown. Divided into an upper section, El Alto, where the Anglo managers lived, and a lower section, El Bajo, where the Mexican workers lived, Smeltertown had its own post office, butcher shop, bakery, cantinas, a theater, San Jose Catholic parish, a YMCA, a public elementary school, and the Smelter Vocational School. Smeltertown was a quintessential company town, in which the company could be both benefactor and tyrant. Former residents say Asarco paid well, better than many other employers of the working class. And yet poverty in Smeltertown could be extreme. Residents built and invested in their homes, but the company owned the land; few families could afford cars; many relied on outhouses into the 1960s. ``As in other single- industry towns, Smeltertown's residents fashioned their own way of life in the world the company made, one marked by inequality, racial segregation, and corporate paternalism,'' Perales writes. The community would flourish for 70 years under the plumes of the smelter's twin smokestacks, ignorant of the pervasive danger. ``A Silent Poison'' In March 1971, a team of Epidemic Intelligence Service officers from the CDC arrived to investigate lead exposure connected to the Asarco smelter. Dr. Bernard Rosenblum, the El Paso City-County health commissioner, had called the CDC after his department discovered that Asarco was discharging large quantities of lead and other metallic wastes into the air. Between 1969 and 1971, the smelter's stacks had spewed more than 1,000 tons of lead, 560 tons of zinc, 12 tons of cadmium, and 1.2 tons of arsenic into the atmosphere. Soil studies showed the highest concentrations of lead and other metals in surface soil closest to the smelter--essentially, in Smeltertown. The city of El Paso was suing Asarco on the basis of those findings alone, but Rosenblum wanted to know more. He was worried about the health of the kids. (OnEarth made several attempts to reach Asarco and its parent company, Grupo Mexico, for comment without success.) The CDC team, led by a 29-year-old pediatrician named Philip Landrigan, began to explore a subject about which precious little was known: lead toxicity, especially its effects on children. Landrigan, now a pediatrician and epidemiologist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, says, ``The notion that lead could be toxic at lower levels was extremely new at that time. Up until 1970 and continuing for years, people believed you didn't have to worry about lead unless it was so high that it made a child seriously sick. The whole idea that lead in the body could be a silent poison was a new concept.'' Landrigan and the CDC team first looked at whether environmental contamination would be reflected in human blood lead levels over three months. The results were startling: Although they found no cases of overt lead poisoning, 43 percent of people in all age groups and 62 percent of children 10 and under living within one mile of the smelter had blood lead levels of at least 40 micrograms per deciliter. That's eight times the level at which the CDC recommends a full-fledged public health response today. Landrigan quickly followed up with a second study in Smeltertown in 1972, examining the health consequences of lead exposure in children. The CDC team administered IQ tests and a finger-tapping test of physical reflexes to the Smeltertown kids with elevated blood levels; a control group of children with blood lead levels below 40 micrograms per deciliter was also tested. The study found that children with elevated blood lead levels tested as many as seven points lower on the IQ test than the control group; they also showed much slower reaction times on the physical reflexes test."

              "American gas prices are too high. The pressure is on this Congress to do something about it. President Biden has done something about it by releasing oil at a strategic time from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and gas prices are down from their peak. But Americans want more. They want real action, and instead, they get what is nothing more than a 2-day fraud on this House floor: a bill that would do absolutely nothing to reduce oil prices or gas prices. Yet, by spending 2 days on the floor and by making this the bill of the week, we fool the American people into thinking that Congress is doing something. Now, how utterly meaningless is this bill? It would do nothing to increase oil production in the United States for it calls only for a plan to be created but not necessarily implemented. It implies that it would do something to increase oil production but not for well more than a year after the crisis began any spike in oil prices. Finally, even if more oil is produced in the United States, it will be exported and will lower the world price perhaps by a penny. This is a messaging bill. Its message is to attack President Biden, who is the only one who has actually done something to reduce oil prices. So let's look at what this bill does. It calls for a plan. If the administration wants to give us a plan, then give us a plan. Washington is filled with plans. The American Petroleum Institute has a plan. Everybody has a plan. So we draft another plan. What does that do? Now, it forces the administration to write a plan about leasing more land for oil drilling. They are free to list parcels where everybody knows there is no oil and nobody wants to bid. If they don't want to do a plan, then that is the plan they will give us. But let's say they give us the plan that the majority seems to want. They can write the plan, accompany it with a letter explaining that they think it won't reduce oil prices and that it is bad for the environment, and therefore they are not going to implement it. So now we have a plan that is similar to what they want and a letter saying why it won't be implemented. This is what we offer the American people? If we are going to have a bill that requires a plan, then we ought to adopt this amendment that offers the administration a chance to create a different kind of plan, a plan to prohibit or limit exports. The illustration of how important this is can be seen just north of our border. Canada produces twice as much oil as they consume, and their consumers are paying $2 a gallon more than we are paying. So producing more oil inside your country doesn't seem to lower oil prices for those living to the north of the United States. Why? Because the oil is simply exported at the world price. Now, that guarantees--if we actually produced more oil in the United States and exported it--more profits for oil companies but not a penny of reduction at the pump. If instead we had a plan to limit or prohibit exports, then we would lower certainly the price of natural gas, and I believe that under many circumstances we would reduce the price of oil and gasoline paid for by the American people. So the majority comes to this floor with a bill requiring a plan to be added to the hundreds of existing plans that already exist that requires the administration to create a plan that the majority tells us the administration doesn't want to create, allows the administration to create a plan that they wouldn't like, allows the administration to create a plan that they would like and then refuse to implement it, and then tells the American people that they are doing something to lower the price of gasoline now. Let's point out that we are going to produce more oil in this country in 2023 than any other year in our history. So this is a message bill that is sending a false message. We are going to produce more oil in 2023 than any other year. But even if we did lease more land, and even if they did drill on it, that is a response that might affect us in 2025. Why don't we have something that will lower gas prices now? So if we want to engage in this process of telling the American people that we are doing something or that we would do something but it is the other party's fault, then for God's sakes, bring forward a bill that if enacted--which, of course, won't happen--but if enacted, that would actually do something. This bill will not increase oil production in the United States, and oil production in the United States, if exported, will do nothing to help the American consumer. Mr. Speaker, vote for my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "Mr. Speaker, today's bill shows that there is no real vision for Republican energy policy. They don't have a path forward. This was their chance to engage meaningfully on energy policy, to set the tone for a new Congress, where we would work together to protect American energy interests. Instead, they are reduced to defending their oil and gas interests and attacking President Biden's successful efforts to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower gas prices for Americans. I have said it before: Republican administrations, Republican Presidents have released oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the past. I am sure that if we had a Republican President now, they would be heralding the fact that he released oil from the reserves in order to bring down gasoline prices at the pump. I want to mention, again, this letter from Secretary Granholm, our Energy Secretary. She states her Department's position on the bill. According to her, this bill would severely restrict or threaten the administration's ability to respond to emergency situations, such as the emergency supply shortage from the one triggered by the war in Ukraine. This bill would not only make it so that gas prices go higher but make it more difficult for us to address supply problems. The Secretary identifies, in my opinion, in irrefutable terms, the Biden administration's successful use of the reserve to lower gas prices for Americans. Now, understand what this bill does. It prohibits the Department of Energy from releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve until it expands oil and gas drilling on Federal lands by the same percentage that it releases oil from the reserve. The previous speaker, Mr. Soto, pointed out that the fossil fuel industry already controls large portions of U.S. public lands and waters, and it isn't using most of it. The problem is not a shortage of leases or land. The problem is a fossil fuel industry more interested in keeping supply artificially low so that prices stay artificially high. They don't want to pump oil because if they do so, then the gas price goes down. That is not what they want. They want to make greater profits. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues, please, the House Republicans are doing the bidding of their Big Oil friends at Americans' expense while threatening the President's ability to take timely actions to lower prices for American consumers at the pump. This bill is a giveaway to Republicans' fossil fuel friends, who already received billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded subsidies and enjoyed record-shattering profits last year at the expense of working families. Releasing oil from the reserve in response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine was a critical, commonsense strategy that helped lower gas prices for American families by a $1.69 per gallon since their peak. Restricting the Federal Government's best tools in the middle of a global energy crisis with no benefit other than increasing the profits of the fossil fuel industry is extreme, and I don't use that word loosely. This bill is an extreme policy that is going to make it so much more difficult for the President to act to deal with the supply chain problems and to try to lower prices for average Americans. It is extreme in the real sense. Mr. Speaker, for that reason, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 21, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 21. Once again, House Republicans are showing their true colors--bringing a bill to the floor that helps their Big Oil friends and hurts hardworking Americans. This is a reckless and extreme bill. It will hamstring the single most important tool the Biden administration has used to fight Putin's price hike on gasoline. The chairwoman mentioned affordability, but by releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the Biden administration helped bring down gas prices by over $1.50 per gallon. Republicans call that politicizing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I call that providing real relief to the American people at the gas pump. Again, Democrats are addressing affordability trying to bring down high gas prices; and now, after promising to lower costs for American families, House Republicans want to pass this bill that will raise gas prices at the pump. Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what this bill would do. It would prevent the Department of Energy from using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to respond to price hikes until Big Oil is given open access to drill on public lands. Restricting the Federal Government's best tool for decreasing gas prices in the middle of a global energy crisis defies any logic. After all, this is a tool that administrations of both parties--Democrat and Republican--have successfully used in the past. It is baffling to me to see Republicans oppose President Biden's release of oil from the reserve considering that in recent years, Republican administrations withdrew even more due to oil sales that they themselves mandated when they were in control of Congress. House Republicans have also used the reserve as a piggy bank to withdraw nearly 300 million barrels of oil to pay for their priorities. Yet now they want to feign outrage that President Biden withdrew fewer barrels to lower prices at the pump. This is not serious legislation, Mr. Speaker, but instead a political stunt. Republicans are just upset that President Biden stood up and actually used all the tools at his disposal to fight back against high gas prices for American families. This bill actually fights against American families and against addressing affordability. The Secretary of Energy was clear in a letter she wrote to Chair Rodgers and me last week. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the text of that letter. The Secretary of Energy, Washington, DC, January 18, 2023. Hon. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Chair, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr., Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Chair Rodgers and Ranking Member Pallone: Congratulations again on your re-elections to Congress and selections as Chair and Ranking Member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. I look forward to working closely with you in the 118th Congress. I write to express the Department of Energy's serious concerns about H.R. 21, the Strategic Production Response Act. From responding swiftly to natural disasters to executing a historic release of oil in response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the Administration's use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has been critical to ensuring adequate oil supply and lowering gasoline prices for American families. This bill would significantly weaken this critical energy security tool, resulting in more oil supply shortages in times of crisis and higher gasoline prices for Americans. Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine created the worst global energy crisis in decades. The President took unprecedented action with allies and partners, releasing oil from our strategic reserves, to stabilize global oil supply and gasoline prices. We have heard directly from industry over the last several months that these actions were essential to maintaining supply. And Americans see the results for themselves at the pump. Today, gasoline prices are down by $1.70 per gallon from their peak this summer. In fact, gasoline prices are now below where they were before Russia's invasion. That was far from a foregone conclusion a year ago. The Treasury Department estimates that the Administration's SPR actions reduced prices for American consumers at the pump by as much as 40 cents per gallon. In addition to saving Americans money, the SPR releases should provide a good deal for taxpayers, by selling oil at a high price, with a planned refill of the SPR at lower prices. If enacted, H.R. 21 would make it harder to take such action quickly to increase supply when the market needs it most--driving up prices during crises. H.R. 21 would significantly interfere with the United States' ability to release oil collectively through the International Energy Agency during an emergency supply shortage, as was done in early March 2022. And H.R. 21 would severely restrict the Department's ability to lend oil when disruptions occur due to natural disasters or pipeline outages. Just last month, when the Keystone Pipeline was suddenly shut down, refiners in Texas and Louisiana were sent scrambling to keep facilities running. This Administration--like those of both parties have previously--quickly lent out oil to help maintain operations, avoid shortages, and prevent further price spikes. H.R. 21 would undermine our ability to take such decisive action in response to future disruptions. I believe it is essential that the SPR can continue to address supply disruptions by rapidly providing oil in response to emergencies. Arbitrarily requiring the completion of reports related to energy production on Federal lands--a matter which the Department of Energy does not control--would only delay such critical action and increase prices for Americans when energy disruptions occur. Today, there is nothing standing in the way of domestic oil production. In fact, oil production is up by 1 million barrels per day under President Biden and is on track to reach a new record high this year. Oil and gas companies are currently sitting on approximately 9,000 approved but unused permits to drill, and billions in record profits. They do not need another giveaway. I appreciate your consideration of these concerns, and I hope we can work together on strategies to ensure American energy productivity, security, and affordability. Sincerely, Jennifer M. Granholm."

              "this amendment goes beyond the status quo in even existing law by creating new barriers to oil exploration and development.

This amendment would prohibit oil and gas companies from producing on a lease outlined in the leasing plan unless the fossil industry entity submits to the Secretary of Energy a plan to reduce its global warming pollution. This amendment is simply nothing more than to delay the implementation of H.R. 21. That is all this is. Let's call it what it is. It is not about a few tanks in the country. Really? It is not about that. Americans are suffering under record-high gas prices that hurt low- income Americans the most, and they want to call that, oh, a discussion about a few tanks in the country.

              "the purpose of the bill is to prevent further abuse of the SPR and require the Secretary to establish a plan to increase and unleash American energy production on Federal lands and offshore waters. This amendment is nothing more than another attempt to limit oil and gas production in the United States. American energy workers are eager to get back to work--we can produce millions more barrels of oil per day instead of relying on OPEC and Russia for our energy needs. President Biden's Department of the Interior only leased 126,228 acres for drilling during his first 19 months in office. To put that in perspective, no other President since Richard Nixon leased out fewer than 4.4 million acres at that stage in their first term. The Biden administration has made it more difficult than any other administration in history to produce energy, and this amendment would add to that. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment will prohibit the leasing plan from including a whole new swath of Federal lands. This is a solution in search of a problem because many of these areas are already protected. I went through the list. I don't see any that aren't. Under existing law, many of these places aren't open for oil and gas leasing. Nothing in H.R. 21 would change that fact. President Biden campaigned on a platform to end fossil fuels, and on day one of his administration, he imposed a moratorium on energy production on Federal lands. The Biden administration has leased fewer acres than any other administration dating all the way back to World War II. H.R. 21 will reverse the dangerous precedent set by President Biden and his administration and unlock the natural resources owned by the American people for the benefit of all. The SPR shouldn't be used for political purposes. Drawing down to influence gas prices is wrong when the SPR is set aside for national emergencies, a time of war. It is a strategic asset for the American people, not to be used to influence elections. This amendment will increase gas prices and weaken our energy security by reimposing the Biden administration's leasing moratorium. It is wrong. It is messaging. I get it. You are okay with releasing gas and oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to influence gas prices, weakening our Nation if a natural disaster should strike. We need to replenish the SPR. We need to do it with the American resources that we are blessed with in this country. That is what H.R. 21 does. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment ensures that this bill, H.R. 21, will not go into effect until the Department of Energy can certify that gas prices won't increase as it develops a plan to expand oil and gas drilling on Federal lands by the same percentage that it releases oil from the SPR. Essentially, if we are going to get more or equal savings from using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve then we would not be expanding drilling on public lands and sell off more lands needlessly. In addition, I know I spoke before about some of the issues we had with the underlying legislation, but I did want to bring a few more facts to bear. When President Trump and the Republicans financed the GOP tax scam for the rich with similar strategic oil reserves, some of that gas was bought by China, by the way. You don't hear about that much, but under President Trump and under President Biden, we saw China buy some of this gas because it was sold to the overall market. Now, we came together, Mr. Speaker, in a bipartisan fashion to limit that. You don't hear a lot in the debate today that Trump sold gas to China or that Trump sold oil to China as so much is talked about President Biden. Fact number two is President Trump had used the strategic reserve when the Saudis and their refineries were attacked. Again, disruption, just like we see with us banning Russian oil in a bipartisan fashion and just like we see with the oil reserve. There is a lot of amnesia here in the Chamber about the historic use under two administrations to try to steady out the price of gas for everyday Americans. Lastly, we opposed for many years eliminating the ability to export America's gas and oil abroad. There was a bipartisan deal a few years ago where we got the ability to continue the tax credits for solar and wind and other renewables, and the Republicans asked us to include an elimination of this ban on exporting fuel abroad. That is a big part of how this all happened, and that is certainly not an America First policy when we hear so much about the debate on the amount of gas and the price of gas here. I will end where I began, which is President Biden helped lower gas prices, and now we are hearing a multihour debate about how they oppose that. I certainly stand with the President, and I yield back the balance of my time."

              "finally, on H.R. 1, the House is expected today to vote on Republicans' partisan, unserious, and so-called energy package that they call H.R. 1. First, once again, I want to make it clear: H.R. 1 is dead on arrival in the Senate, not because of politics but because it is so ridiculous and has been drawn up by a bunch of pro-oil Senators who have no regard for anyone else. No Democrat has been consulted. Obviously, the Republicans knew that in the House when they passed it, but they seem to want to go back. In H.R. 1, they go back to the MAGA supporters back home--the big oil companies, the oil wildcatters, and so many of the oil States that don't want to pay any taxes and that don't want anything to do with moving us forward as the climate gets worse and worse. The Senate is not going to waste our time on a bill that sets America back decades in our transition to clean energy. All it takes is a brief glance at H.R. 1 to realize it is just a giveaway to Big Oil. House Republicans' so-called energy package just guts important safeguards, environmental safeguards, on fossil fuel projects. It would lock America into expensive, erratic, and dirty energy sources while setting us back more than a decade on our decision to move forward on clean energy, which this Nation fully supports. Transmission, of course, is hugely important to increasing access on clean energy, but the Republican plan hardly even mentions it. So, again, the way to do this, Republicans in the House, is in a bipartisan way. We have a Republican House. We have a Democratic Senate. No party is going to be able to jam its way through without consulting the other side. That is true on the debt ceiling. That is true on the budget, and it is certainly true on H.R. 1. There are Republicans in the House and Democrats in the House, and there are Republicans in the Senate and Democrats in the Senate who want to sit down and do a serious energy package. We need to do it. Let's stop this brinksmanship. Let's stop this political game-playing. Let's stop this throwing of bones to the MAGA hard right, which represents, maybe, 5 percent of America. Let's roll up our sleeves. Let's get down to work and get something done on energy and on so many other issues.",
              "energy is the most important element of a prosperous society. Nothing else functions without it. Reliable electricity allows us to work at night, keep our sick and injured on life support, heat our homes in freezing weather, manufacture the materials that we use to build our homes, and powers the systems that allow the public to watch these remarks right here on this House floor. Energy is connected to everything. The price of energy affects the price of everything else, and the world devolves into the Dark Ages without it. This might explain why Republicans think an energy bill should be labeled H.R. 1--because it is our number one priority, as it should be. We have to introduce this bill because, bewilderingly, energy security has been under relentless attack by radical leftists and the Biden administration. They don't believe in energy security. They don't believe in reliable, affordable energy. They seem to think that the only energy worth pursuing is so-called renewables, solar and wind. This is not sound policy or science. This has become a religion, and it has become an irrational pursuit of intermittent, weather-dependent energy sources that take up vast amounts of land, vast amounts of resources to make, and vast amounts of critical minerals to be mined. Still, it doesn't deliver the energy security the American people need. I am not against these things. It would be fine to pursue these technologies if it didn't also come with a simultaneous attack on the sources of energy that actually work--namely, oil and gas. Every good thing you have in this world, Mr. Speaker, is because of petroleum products--every single thing. Your shoes, your cars, your iPhones, your Netflix, your Patagonia jackets, medical devices that save your life, your heating, your cooling--literally everything comes from petroleum products. The attack on oil and gas has been relentless, and it has been deeply foolish. It started with day one of the Biden administration and the Keystone pipeline, then executive orders banning new leases on Federal lands, and then refusal to permit pipelines. Then they turn around and attack the suppliers and producers for higher prices. It is pure gaslighting. They have drained our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, all while prioritizing the same crazy climate policies that have caused Europe to enter an energy crisis and that are now causing developing nations to be priced out of gas markets and turn to coal production. This gets me to quite the irony here. The administration's policies are more likely to increase global carbon emissions as a result, and for one simple reason. I really want everyone to understand this. By refusing to push for increased natural gas exports, we are shelving the best tool for displacing coal power around the world. Coal burned in foreign countries accounts for about 50 percent of global power emissions. Natural gas is an easy substitute with half the emissions. American natural gas could easily be leveraged to increase prosperity for all and reduce emissions. This is not rocket science. It is common sense. It is just math. Promoting American natural gas is better for energy security, better for our own affordability, and better for reducing global emissions. There is no logical counterargument to what I just said. There is not one. Maybe--I believe this--the Biden administration actually knows this. That is why they prefer oil production in foreign countries and beg them to drill so that we can pretend we care about the climate while allowing other countries to do the dirty work for us.",
              "I rise today in opposition of H.R. 1, the misleadingly named Lower Energy Costs Act. I had everything written down of what I was going to say, but then I started hearing some other stuff. I decided that what I wanted to talk about is a few things. Number one: I need the American people to understand that H.R. 1 means that this is the first bill. This is the bill that the party in power thinks matters most. This is where their priorities lie. When you look at what the Democrats did, they decided that they wanted to stand for democracy after there were those that wanted to try to tear our democracy apart. I have to rest here for a second, simply because at the time I was a Texas House Representative who had to flee my State because of voting rights. I urged this House to pass H.R. 1, simply because we were trying to make sure that people would not cheat in these elections. Just because you have control of the House doesn't mean that you didn't take your time and gerrymander these lines because we know that is exactly what happened. That is the only reason that the Democrats are not currently in control. The reason that this margin is so tight is because our policies stand for the people. Let's talk about this bill. This bill is about putting people over polluters. If we want to talk about what the Republicans do when they are in control and they get to decide about power, let's talk about the State of Texas. Let's talk about the fact that we have left the State of Texas in the dark over and over. It was interesting to look across the aisle and see a sign that said that the Republicans will keep the lights on. Well, go talk to Texas and find out if the lights have been kept on or if we have been left in the dark. We are consistently left in the dark because there is this idea that if we just go ahead and get rid of regulations that everything will work out. Unfortunately, it has not worked out. It has not worked out to the tune of us actually losing lives in the State of Texas. That is why we are here standing before you, making sure that we are fighting for actual lower bills when it comes to our everyday working families that are already squeezed by inflation. We heard Mr. Speaker talk about the fact that he wanted to make sure there was more money in people's pockets for medicine. When it came down to voting for the Inflation Reduction Act, I don't believe that there were too many Republicans that were voting for that--to make sure we could lower the cost of insulin--just to make sure that the Record is clear--if we want to make sure we are putting more money into their pockets. House Republicans want to lower energy costs for big polluters, plain and simple. That means somebody foots the bill and somebody pays the price. Once again, go ask my constituents in Texas. We are the ones who are footing the bill for the failures of our grid over and over and over. My constituents tend to be Black and Brown, mostly, and they tend to be those that are disproportionately living in polluted communities today, that are only able to breathe because of the scant environmental protections we actually have. They are being asked to not only endure the brunt of pollution, but also endure the bill of pollution. I will not and I cannot stand for it. When this bill guts Clean Air Act safeguards to let polluters earn profits faster by curtailing the already paltry public comment period, my constituents foot the bill."

              "I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 1, House Republicans' polluters over people act. When the House Democratic majority passed the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, they delivered key environmental safeguards to bolster our clean energy economy and lower costs. The legislation that Republicans are bringing to the floor attempts to undermine those promising provisions because of political animus. Instead of trying to meet the needs of the American taxpayer, they are working to line the pockets of fossil fuel tycoons and exacerbate toxic mining projects that directly harm communities like mine. H.R. 1 is not about the people, it is about a political win, and it is hooey. This legislation would undo significant environmental regulations central to our public health and environmental protections at a time when people are facing an alarming pattern of severe weather, lack of access to clean water and air, and blatant pollution across the country. Pollution kills people. I can tell you that no one here is breathing dirty air. No one here is drinking dirty water. No one here is growing anything in dirty soil. If we are not, that means that no one else should be forced to do so. It would roll back the environmental review processes under NEPA, putting community health and safety at risk while worsening pollution and the health risks associated with toxic chemicals such as PFAS, the same forever chemicals that are killing our firefighters. I urge you to listen to the committee hearings where you will hear them say there is no need for community engagement, polluters can self- monitor. That is why I was so disappointed but, oh, not surprised when Republicans voted down my amendment to include an environmental analysis and review of how oil and gas development will impact community health and safety because it will. Instead, Republicans are so eager to rush into free-for-all oil and gas development that they are unable to reckon with the serious health consequences they are pawning off onto our constituents. You would have more respect for a bill if they cared enough about the health and safety of your community, if they wanted to protect your child or your grandmother's health. Unfortunately, we know that the Black community is disproportionately impacted by environmental pollution. I have talked about what is going on in my district every single week. Black Americans are three times more likely to die of asthma after continued exposure to polluted air, a result of historic, systemic racism. This legislation makes it virtually impossible for impacted communities to file lawsuits against corporate polluters for environmental and public health damages, so it is killing your lungs and silencing your voice. It continues to put mining rights ahead of the interests of the community, especially in indigenous communities where mining was used to settle the West. This bill declares that indigenous communities shouldn't even be consulted about what is going on on their lands, to rip away lands from indigenous communities in favor of our own traditional, patriarchal, American individualistic interests. Even more than that, we have seen ties between environmental racism and increased rates of gender violence at these mining sites where indigenous women and girls are attacked by employees at the man camps. Now they don't even care about the safety of women and girls. Polling shows that two-thirds of Americans want legislation that addresses the climate crisis, proving once again that Republicans answer to special interests and not the will of the people. This is all about dirty money, profits over people, and it is disgraceful. Shame on them, Mr. Speaker, for deliberately ignoring the health of our people and the environment. I oppose this bill and any other fossil fuel cash grabs the Republicans send our way.",
              "I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 1, the polluters over people act. Although energy independence and lower costs are laudable goals for any energy legislation, unfortunately, this bill achieves neither. Instead, H.R. 1 is a giveaway to Big Oil and their lobbyists, who want to be able to set their own rules at the expense of working families. Instead of putting the needs of the American public at the center of this bill, my friends across the aisle drafted an industry wish list. First, H.R. 1 undermines landmark environmental laws and protections like the Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Policy Act that safeguard public health and keep our drinking water and air clean. It also repeals the methane emissions reduction program, which helps companies reduce their methane pollution. This bill makes it easier for polluters to set their own standards and roll back reforms, and it lets Big Oil rubberstamp their own projects with minimal oversight. Environmental disasters are far too common, and unfortunately, H.R. 1 would make it easier for future disasters to happen. Second, the polluters over people act worsens the climate crisis by empowering the fossil fuel industry instead of strengthening the foundation for a clean energy future, which is so important. During the last Congress, the 117th Congress, we passed policies-- many bipartisan policies--like the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, that invested in climate action at a scale matching the challenge that science tells us that we face. This bill that we have before us today not only ignores the additional steps we need to take to reach our climate targets, but it actively takes us backward on climate action by rolling back key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, which was and is the most significant environmental and climate bill that has ever been passed in the United States or anywhere else. We know that data is alarming. A new U.N. report found that global warming could increase by 3.2 degrees Celsius and cause 7 feet of sea level rise by the end of the century if immediate actions are not taken. This is an existential crisis. Climate change is real. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle know it is real, and we cannot continue to deny this and put our planet at risk with this type of legislation. Instead of wasting time on this Big Oil wish list, I would like for us, instead, to focus on actions that will actually expand the employment of clean energy, reduce costs, expand high-capacity transmission, reform the interconnection process, and build on the $1 billion that we secured in the Inflation Reduction Act to ensure that Federal agencies have the resources and expertise to conduct efficient environmental reviews. Third, H.R. 1 adds to the deficit. That is right, it adds to the deficit by giving handouts to big oil and gas corporations so that their executives and their shareholders can get even richer. For a party that is focused--at least, I hear that they are--on tackling the deficit, I think it is pretty extraordinary that this legislation, their signature legislation would add to the deficit. Last year, when Americans were dealing with high costs at the pump, fossil fuel executives were taking in record profits. In fact, 26 of the country's largest oil companies made a record-breaking $451 billion last year, just last year, and they spent over $163 billion on stock buybacks and dividends to their shareholders. These same companies donated over $370,000 to my friends across the aisle, so it is no wonder they want to reward their friends. It is clear that this legislation, the polluters over people act, is another giveaway, to keep corporations rich at the American people's expense without making meaningful reforms. In fact, while making things worse. For all these reasons and more, I strongly oppose this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I proposed four amendments that would begin to correct course, but unfortunately my friends across the aisle are only allowing two of those amendments to come to the floor. My first amendment that was blocked would clarify that lead Federal agencies can extend a public comment period or gather further community input if the Secretary determines that doing so would improve project results or efficiency. This would allow agencies to actually streamline the permitting process by ensuring that potentially impacted communities and local governments have the ability to fully engage in the process. Instead, my friends across the aisle chose to block consideration of this amendment and perpetuate the myth--it is a myth--that community input somehow slows down project approvals. My other amendment that was blocked would have banned offshore drilling off the southern California coast. Californians of both political parties have made it absolutely clear, overwhelmingly clear that they are strongly opposed to additional offshore oil and gas drilling in southern California off the coast. This amendment would have offered this Congress an opportunity to respect the will of the overwhelming majority of Californians who oppose drilling off our coasts. I strongly urge my friends across the aisle, allow debate on these and other amendments so that more voices are heard. As my colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee have heard me say before, I am willing to work with anyone--anyone--on either side of the aisle to meet the goals of lowering energy costs and protecting our planet, particularly in terms of promoting a more efficient and transparent permitting process. I hope we can do that. We can find common ground on pragmatic solutions. This is not common ground. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no.''",
              "I rise today to ensure that the American people and every single New Mexican back home in my home State knows exactly what this bill is all about. H.R. 1 is not a bill to cut costs and unlock American energy. H.R. 1 is a blatant giveaway of public lands, public waters, and public minerals to the highest bidder. It guts environmental laws, it opens oil and gas leasing to mining and multinational companies, and it will send our communities and our laws back to the 19th century--the 19th century--to 1847 specifically, when we opened the West through the hardrock mining law to minerals claims and multinational corporations, who took advantage of our communities, who dumped tailings piles into our rivers and our streams, and who strip-mined sacred and ancestral lands of our indigenous communities. That is right. This bill would take us back before the automobile was invented, before we had electricity, before women had the right to vote in this country, and before New Mexico even became a territory of the United States when our communities, lands, and waters were stripped away from them and given to the highest bidder. So let me be clear: This legislation is not about lowering costs. It is not about lessening the burden at the pump. It is not about lowering costs for our families. These are just talking points that have been provided by fossil fuel and mining companies and by their allies across the aisle who see the opportunity to strip away environmental regulations and vast amounts of public resources, lands, and waters for private profit. In fact, this bill will increase the deficit, robbing our communities of more than a century of hard-fought environmental wins to protect our lands and waters. That is why House Democrats have a clear message today: Not on our watch. Let's be clear and talk exactly about what this bill is and does. My friends, Mr. Speaker, on the other side of the aisle want to claim that this bill will create jobs, that more drilling and mining will lower costs, and that it is going to somehow magically solve our global critical mineral shortage. Let me be clear, as somebody whose parents worked in the energy industry. My father was a welder in the oil and gas fields; my mother, a crane mechanic at a coal-fired power plant. As somebody who spent over two decades of my career working on natural resources issues, let me say it loud and clear: We cannot mine and drill our way to solve these problems. In fact, this bill not only does not help our communities but puts our Nation and our planet at risk. Scientists from across the world released a report just last week that made clear that if we do not take significant action right now to curb global emissions, we will cross a global tipping point and catastrophic global climate change. This bill would threaten our global planetary health. In fact, this legislation, which the President has already said he would veto, would open vast swaths of our land and our water to oil and gas drilling, to mining, not to lower costs, but to line the pockets of wealthy oil companies. In the name of streamlining, it would gut environmental laws like the National Environmental Policy Act, a piece of bipartisan legislation that Richard Nixon signed; the Clean Water Act; the Clean Air Act. It would gut protections for our communities to be able to actually have a say in what happens in their own lands and waters. It would make it easier for large corporations to pollute and dump toxins without consequence. Finally, this legislation not only does not lower costs but raises the deficit by billions of dollars. So I ask the American people and I ask New Mexicans: Is this what you want Congress working on, a 175-page bill filled with thinly veiled corporate giveaways that gut our environmental laws, that cut our communities out, and that would line the pockets of private corporations? No. The American people want clean air. They want clean water. They want climate action. They want a planet that they can leave to their children. That is why Democrats and the President fought to pass the Inflation Reduction Act just a few months ago in this Chamber. That bill makes the largest investment in climate action ever in the history of this country and ever in the history of this planet. Our bill, the bill we passed to address the global climate crisis, will create millions of jobs. It will rebuild our infrastructure and our local economies. It will invest in our communities and the resilience of our ecosystems. It will reduce household costs like our friends across the aisle are trying to claim with this giveaway bill. Guess what? It reduces the deficit, all while putting us on a path to cutting carbon emissions in this country by 40 percent by 2030. Guess what else happened? Not a single Republican in this Chamber voted for that bill. Not one. Not one Member on the other side of the aisle voted to lower costs, voted for a clean energy future, voted to protect the environment, voted to protect our communities. We cannot drill and mine our way to a clean energy and climate secure future. Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford to pass H.R. 1. We cannot afford to send our communities back to the 19th century. We cannot afford to let private companies deforest and strip-mine our lands. We cannot afford to go back to a time when rivers were on fire, and companies dumped toxins into our groundwater with impunity. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this legislation because the path is clear. We must take climate action now and build a clean energy economy and leave a livable planet for our communities, for the future, and for our Nation."

              "H.R. 21 is really about strengthening the SPR by requiring nonemergency use to be accompanied by a plan to produce American oil resources. Increased supply of American-produced energy lowers costs for all Americans. Energy security provides all communities with reliable, clean, and affordable energy. This is fundamental for our jobs, economic health, and for communities to strive for better opportunities. It reduces energy poverty. Lower-income households pay a higher percentage of their income for energy. Lower costs help everyone. Greater supplies lower costs, and create jobs here in America with American-produced energy resources. This amendment misses the point. It is an unnecessary messaging exercise. Let's focus on results for Americans, American jobs, American energy. I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I think we need to remember that H.R. 21 is about strengthening the SPR by requiring any nonemergency use to be accompanied by a plan to produce American oil resources. This amendment undermines the purpose of the bill. It would deprive the country of the benefits of secure American supplies of cleanly produced fossil energy. We should reject this anti-American energy amendment. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment would prohibit the bill from taking effect until the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with other Federal agencies, certifies that this bill will not result in an increase to the average price of energy for Americans. The world's largest supply of emergency crude oil--the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--was established to reduce the devastating impact of supply shocks on prices. When supply shocks are allowed to occur uninhibited, prices rise, and the American people suffer. Whether it is mile-long lines at your local gas station or home energy costs that force families into the cold or heat, supply shocks in energy markets hurt people. They might not hurt some of my colleagues' neighborhoods, but they certainly hurt mine. My constituents would feel deeply the pain that would happen if the President was not permitted to utilize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to do its job. All too often, affording to keep the lights on is an everyday struggle for my constituents and for many other Americans, as well. My district, the Virgin Islands, has among the highest residential and commercial electric rates in the country. The SPR is one of the few mechanisms that the Federal Government has to prevent ever-growing price pressures from crushing people. Less than 1 year ago, in the face of global crude oil instability following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, President Biden acted with great positive effect to make measured drawdowns from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, causing price reductions by as much as 40 cents per gallon at the pump. Today, average gasoline prices are down by more than $1.50 per gallon from their peak last summer. So the utilization of the SPR thus far to release oil into the market has been very effective for American taxpayers. The SPR is a force for good when it is allowed to operate unencumbered. However, this bill would significantly weaken this critical energy security tool and hamstring the President's ability to utilize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a time of disruption, which will result in more oil supply shortages. It would do so by making it harder to withdraw oil into the market quickly to increase supply when the market needs it most--which will drive up gasoline prices. The President must be able to rapidly provide oil from the SPR to address supply disruptions and respond to emergencies. Arbitrarily requiring the completion of reports related to energy production on Federal lands specifically--a matter which the Department of Energy does not control--would only delay response and increase prices when energy disruptions occur. So my amendment is simple. It provides that SPR utilization may not be limited unless the Secretary of Energy certifies that this would not push up average energy prices in America. Nothing is standing in the way of domestic oil production. Oil production is up by 1 million barrels per day under President Biden and is on track to reach a new record high this year. There are nearly 10,000 approved but unused permits to drill. The basic rules of economics must continue to apply. The SPR should continue to serve as a flexible and responsible emergency supply recourse to put down pressure on energy prices. Under my amendment, this bill must not yield the opposite and raise energy prices. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to please approve my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time."

              "this amendment simply extends existing reporting requirements. The underlying section allows the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to accept and expend funds from non- Federal entities in order to pay for staff and information technology system development to expedite permit processing. They are authorized to accept funds in fiscal years 2023 through 2025. In the original bill text, both Secretaries are required to submit annual statements to the committees of jurisdiction explaining why one or both of the following scenarios occurs: They do not accept funds contributed; or They accept but do not expend the funds contributed. This amendment adds the requirement that both Secretaries submit a report to the committee of jurisdiction that includes, for each expenditure authorized: The amount of funds accepted, and The contributing non-Federal entity. I know most folks probably don't read these reports, and they throw them in a pile. However, for future oversight efforts, it is important for the U.S. Congress to both specifically enumerate that agencies retain this information and then require them to provide it to us so not only we can see it but the American people can see how the money is being spent and who is spending it and who is giving it. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "again, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding. I do rise in support of this amendment. H.R. 1 would allow non-Federal entities to provide money to certain Federal agencies to improve permitting efficiency. This good-governance amendment, offered by my friend from Pennsylvania, would require the Secretaries who accept this money to report on where it came from and how much was provided. I think there is some confusion about the intent of what is in H.R. 1 about speeding up permitting. Mr. Speaker, before I came to Congress, I did engineering work for over two decades. I am a professional engineer, so I worked on a lot of projects where permits were required. Fortunately, we were working with State permitting agencies, and we would hear the same argument from the State permitting agencies: We don't have enough resources and enough people to do these permits. It is going to take longer. A lot of States have programs where they allow the entity trying to attain the permit to pay money to the agency so their employees can work overtime. It is really a way to increase the resources and get more out of the resources. It is not degrading the environmental protections at all. It is just moving the process forward at a faster rate. That is what the intent of H.R. 1 is: to move permitting at a faster clip so we can build all kinds of energy; so we can build solar farms and windmills and high-voltage transmission lines; so we can build pipelines; so we can extract minerals and resources here in America. We can process those and we can manufacture things from them. This is important to making our country a leader in the world by overcoming the position we are in with China on minerals and the position we are in with Russia and OPEC. Mr. Speaker, I support the underlying principle in the bill, and I support the good-governance amendment by my friend from Pennsylvania.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer an amendment requiring permitting agencies to determine their technology needs and report them to Congress. Like many of my colleagues across the aisle, I support permitting reforms. We can agree that existing permitting programs are onerous, saddling Americans with rules and regulations that are challenging at best to navigate. Unfortunately, both parties share some of the blame for creating this mess. It is Congress that has spent decades under-resourcing permitting agencies, a big cause of the backlog we are seeing today. Congress' infrastructure investments of the last few years are critical for my district and the entire country. Simply funding projects is not enough, though. That is not the goal of recent legislation. Getting projects built is the goal. Whether it is bridges, broadband, ports, or power lines, making sure that permits are being issued in a consistent and timely manner is key to any project's success. I want to make clear that ensuring predictability is an important piece of the permitting puzzle, one often left out of the discussion. When someone is applying for permits, potential approval or disapproval shouldn't be at the whims of whoever is reviewing their application. Using new technology to improve consistency can help provide the certainty that businesses crave to pursue critical projects in the first place. These reforms can't continue to help big businesses beat out our small businesses. The endless red tape involved in getting permits is a major burden for small businesses. In sector after sector of our economy, market consolidation is squeezing America's small businesses and harming consumers. A business of five employees should be on a level playing field with a business of 5,000 employees when it comes to navigating the permitting system. Ensuring that predictability is one way permitting programs can work better for small businesses. Right now we don't even know what resources permitting agencies need, and that is why the provision in H.R. 1 that agencies assess their staffing needs and report them to Congress is so important. My amendment simply extends that requirement to cover technology, as well. Technology, we all know, is changing so fast right now, and giving permitting agencies better tools can help on so many fronts. New software, including programs using machine learning, can better coordinate simultaneous application reviews by agencies, it can improve agencies' communication with applicants so they can know where their permits are in the process and any additional material that may be needed for certification. New technology can improve predictability and timely review. This is a straightforward measure that would help make the government work the way it ought to. Congress needs to make sure that permitting agencies have the staff, technology, and resources to issue permits and expand permitting capacity. I am proud to offer this amendment to ensure agencies' technology needs are met, and I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "Amendment No. 30 expresses the sense of Congress that the royalty rate for onshore Federal oil and gas leases be 12\\1/2\\ percent. This amendment establishes that it is the sense of Congress that the royalty rate of onshore Federal oil and gas leases be 12\\1/2\\ percent, the pre-Inflation Reduction Act level. The so-called Inflation Reduction Act was filled with horrific policy and has only made things worse. The Inflation Reduction Act is geared to severely harm American energy independence by, among other things, increasing royalty rates and fees while restricting access to energy resources. Our country needs to produce more energy, not less, but Democrats designed their extreme climate agenda to restrict oil and natural gas production. One measure of the so-called Inflation Reduction Act enabled the Biden administration to raise the oil and gas royalty rate for certain offshore leases from the current 12\\1/2\\ percent to 16.67. This measure will only result in less oil and gas production, harming consumers and our national security. The Biden administration doesn't even pretend otherwise. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said, It resets how and what we consider to be the highest and best use of American resources. This is about the use of the land, and the Biden administration clearly wants to block all of our lands from the use for oil and gas production. My amendment simply returns onshore royalty rates to what it was 2 years ago, before this radical Democrat intervention. This amendment would affirm the intent of the underlying bill, which would reset the royalty rate for onshore leases to 12\\1/2\\ percent. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "my amendment would prohibit any new leases under this plan that do not provide a fair return for taxpayers. For far too long, our oil and gas leasing program has offered a sweetheart deal for the industry at the expense of taxpayers. One fossil fuel company recently even went so far as to outline in a press release the many benefits of extraction on public land compared to private land. Their release highlighted that leases on public lands are cheaper, they last longer, and they are more expansive. While these statements may be music to the ears of those who care most about Big Oil special interests, they represent a raw deal for the American people. Increasing the royalty rate to a fair level will generate billions of dollars in revenue for taxpayers. The Government Accountability Office and Congressional Budget Office both agree and have suggested that this is good policy. That is why last Congress I introduced the Restoring Community Input and Public Protections in Oil and Gas Leasing Act, to protect taxpayers by eliminating noncompetitive oil and gas leasing and raising the onshore oil and gas royalty rate, rental fee, and minimum bid amount. I am proud that the Inflation Reduction Act includes significant provisions of that bill, including eliminating noncompetitive leasing for oil and gas sales, raising annual rental rates, and increasing the minimum bid for public lands. These provisions will go a long way in ensuring the American people see a more fair return on the use of our cherished public lands. But we have more work to do to provide a fair return. States like Texas and Oklahoma charge higher royalty rates on their State lands than are charged on Federal public lands, leading to lost revenue for Federal taxpayers. This amendment builds on those provisions and will help end giveaways of our public lands to fossil fuel companies and ensure that taxpayers receive a fair return on any private profit that oil and gas companies extract from our public lands. The American people deserve to see a fair financial return on the profits that fossil fuel companies make from their use of our cherished public lands, and this amendment will require that these companies provide that return instead of simply ripping the public off. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "my first amendment will strike title V of division B of this bill. Throughout this debate, I have heard my friends across the aisle argue that the bill before us today is a reasonable attempt to reform our permitting system. Unfortunately, this bill closely resembles a wish list for Big Oil and their lobbyists. This amendment would strike one of the most egregious portions of the bill that would undo many of the reforms we made last Congress to ensure that the American people see a better return on our public lands and waters. We should all be able to agree that the American people deserve a fair deal when it comes to the use of our cherished public lands. For far too long, our oil and gas leasing program has offered a sweetheart deal for the fossil fuel industry at the expense of taxpayers. One fossil fuel company even went so far as to outline in a press release the many benefits of extraction on public land compared to private land. Their release highlighted that leases on public lands are cheaper, last longer, and are more expansive. While these statements may be music to the ears of those who care most about Big Oil interests, they represent a raw and an unfair deal for the American people. Increasing the royalty rate to a fair level--that is all we are asking, a fair level--will generate billions of dollars in revenue for taxpayers. The Government Accountability Office and Congressional Budget Office both agree and have suggested that it is good policy. That is why, last Congress, I introduced the Restoring Community Input and Public Protections in Oil and Gas Leasing Act to protect taxpayers by eliminating noncompetitive oil and gas leasing and raising the onshore oil and gas royalty rate, rental fee, and minimum bid amount. I am proud that the Inflation Reduction Act includes significant provisions of that bill, including eliminating noncompetitive leasing for oil and gas sales, raising annual rental rates, and increasing the minimum bid for public lands. These commonsense reforms were simply long-overdue fixes to create more balanced fiscal terms and bring Federal lands in line with what States and private landowners already charge. Before the IRA, the fiscal terms for public lands leasing and drilling were, in some cases, over 100 years old. For decades, these outdated rates and fees allowed oil CEOs to lease public lands for pennies on the dollar and unfairly increase their profits at the expense of taxpayers. Even after the IRA, States like Texas and Oklahoma still charge higher royalty rates on their State lands than are charged on Federal public lands. According to Taxpayers for Common Sense, these updated fiscal terms included in the IRA will not raise prices at the pump or consumer energy prices, but they will raise billions of dollars in additional revenue that could go toward our funding education, healthcare, and infrastructure improvements that benefit everyone, not just oil and gas companies. Unfortunately, the bill before us today would also reinstate noncompetitive leasing, an indefensible practice. The Government Accountability Office also found that 99 percent of noncompetitive leases issued between 2003 and 2009 never produced oil and gas during their 10-year lease terms. The reason why these lands were not put into production is that they are leased in areas where there is virtually no likelihood of development. At its core, noncompetitive leasing is a wasteful practice that forces the Bureau of Land Management to expend limited public agency time and resources administering leases that hardly ever generate returns for taxpayers. It encourages oil and gas companies to buy up lands they will never use to pad their portfolios and appease shareholders, contributing to the 12.3 million acres of leased public lands that these companies are currently sitting on and not using. Instead of maintaining these commonsense reforms and protecting the interests of American taxpayers, title V of the bill before us today would undo all of these reforms and provide a gift to oil and gas interests. By rolling back these reforms, the majority is proposing policies that would only pad Big Oil's pocketbooks even further and increase our Federal deficit by $160 million over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, even as companies like ExxonMobil and Shell are announcing record profits. By striking this title, we can put these dollars back in the pockets of the American people and protect commonsense reforms that are finally ensuring that Federal taxpayers receive a fair return on any private profit that oil and gas companies extract from our public lands. I urge my colleagues to stand up for the American people and stand against our increasing national debt by supporting this amendment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "once again, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment, which would unnecessarily waive fundamental environmental laws for wildfire mitigation activity adjacent to roads. Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill we are considering today is a polluter wish list of environmental shortcuts designed to open our public lands to more and more extraction while cutting the public out of the decisionmaking process. The bottom line is, I simply do not think that Congress should be in the business of waiving requirements outlined in the Endangered Species Act or the National Environmental Protection Act. These laws provide critical protections that guide the management of our public lands and waters--critical protections that do not hinder efforts to mitigate wildfire risk or manage our forests. In fact, many of the activities contemplated by the amendment are covered under existing categorical exclusions, which allow land management agencies to carry out routine projects in a fast, efficient, and flexible manner. I will not deny that carrying out wildfire mitigation projects across our national forest and public land is a critical priority. However, we do not have to cast aside environmental standards to get it done. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I thank our chairman for his diligent work on H.R. 1 and the amendments that are going with it. I appreciate it. Mr. Speaker, I rise today not only to support H.R. 1, that will make long overdue changes to our permitting system and allow time-sensitive projects to be considered and approved in a reasonable timeframe, but I am also in support of two amendments that I am very pleased to see included. The first amendment is No. 23, otherwise known as the Combustion Avoidance along Rural Roads Act, or the CARR Act. The CARR Act is named after the 2018 devastating wildfire that occurred in Redding, California, that started from a flat trailer tire igniting roadside vegetation. This fire coined the term ``firenado'' as it occurred there with the deadly winds that whipped that fire into what became a 230,000-acre blaze that also took eight lives. This bill would waive time-consuming requirements under NEPA and the ESA for wildfire mitigation activities conducted within 300 feet of a roadway. These wildfire mitigation activities would include thinning, hazardous fuels reduction, prescribed burning, and vegetation management, and be overseen by the Department of the Interior or USDA, and be conducted on Federal land as administered by the National Park system, the Bureau of Land Management, or the Forest Service. Roadways, of course, can be a higher risk area for combustion. It only makes sense to do the type of thinning and management along roadways to vastly reduce that risk. Had this been in practice already, the Carr fire likely would not have happened. I hope we can have this kind of common sense be applied toward our roadsides under the CARR Act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "amendment No. 24, also known also the CLEAR Zones Act, is an enhancement of the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act. This amendment would extend the hazard zone around power lines to allow utility companies to clear trees that pose a danger to transmission infrastructure. It also gives automatic approval of vegetation management plans after 60 days, which keeps these plans moving forward while still giving adequate time for reasonable review instead of needless delays in these critical fire risk zones. During debate, I have heard some of my colleagues refer to this amendment and other proposals in H.R. 1 as a giveaway, in this case, to utility companies, or a trashing of the environment. That is offensively untrue. Indeed, the environment suffers much more by the massive amount of fire we are talking about. Both of my amendments are a direct response to wildfires that have already occurred in my district. Had they been in place, largely, the Camp fire that destroyed the town of Paradise, 153,000 acres and took 85 lives, would not have happened, as a fire caught from foliage that was underneath a power line. Also, the million-acre Dixie fire that occurred in my district from what looked like a healthy tree falling into a power line, destroyed two towns additionally, Greenville and Canyondam. I was there at Canyondam 5 minutes before it was lost completely. Unlike most environmental regulations, this policy is not just about potential future effects, it is also about the fires that have already happened. They have already destroyed homes, already taken lives. This is a message to those folks that your suffering was not needless. It is about stopping these wildfires from happening again by having wise management around our power lines so that the odds of fire occurring from these power lines existing in our rural areas is reduced greatly. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

              "this amendment simply ensures that no undue influence can be wielded by the Chinese Communist Party using an existing provision, which I think reflects the overall sentiment behind this anti-CCP and forced labor provision of the entire bill. The underlying section allows the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to accept and expend funds from non-Federal entities in order to pay for staff and information technology system development to expedite permit processing. They are authorized to accept funds in fiscal years 2023 through 2025. This amendment prohibits those Secretaries from accepting contributions from non-Federal entities owned by the Communist Party of China or a person or entity acting on behalf of the Communist Party of China. Seems pretty common sense. There are already provisions in the bill which would prohibit the CCP's involvement in certain parts of our energy market. They should not be allowed to participate in this one any more than they do in the others. There is no reason that our government should be accepting money from this well. Let's remind ourselves that we are not talking about the people of China who wish to breathe free, like all people in the world do. We are talking about the Communist Party of China. We don't need anything from them. Mr. Speaker, I urge support and adoption of this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank the ranking member and appreciate bipartisan support on this very important amendment. I think this is a sign that we are making progress. This is a sign that America is coming together to stand up against the Chinese Communist Party. We need to stand up not only against them but we need to continue standing up against Russia, against OPEC. That is what H.R. 1 does. It is a bold step in the right direction, and this is a small part of it. I commend the gentleman from Tennessee for crafting this amendment and for getting it made in order. I support the amendment for a very good reason: We simply cannot let the Chinese Communist Party continue to dominate and take control of not only mineral supply chains but energy supply chains as they are trying to make a move in that area as well, where they are cozying up with the Saudis. They are working with Russia to buy the oil and gas that we have banned from there. Their objective is dominance. They have made great strides in the minerals area, and they are working very hard to do that in energy. The way we push back against China and the CCP is we produce our energy and minerals here, and we, for sure, don't let China come to America and own any kind of lease on Federal lands or private lands. We produce it ourselves. We send it to our allies. There was a delegation recently in Germany, and the message they brought back from Germany was gas equals peace. They want us to send them our gas, and we have ample supplies of it. We just need the pipelines. We need the ports. We need the LNG facilities. We need the vessels to send gas to Europe that is much cleaner than the gas they are getting from Russia. It will help bring peace in Europe if they can get more of our energy here. Mr. Speaker, I again commend the gentleman, and I support the amendment.",
              "I rise today in support of my amendment to require the Secretary of Energy to disclose certain stakeholder meetings with any entity that has: one, ties to the People's Republic of China or the Chinese Communist Party; two, has produced studies regarding or has advocated for policies to limit, restrict, or ban the use of any type of energy; and, three, has applied for or received Federal funds. We have recently seen concerning examples of anti-energy, China- connected entities receiving not just elevated access to the White House and Federal agencies but granting of funds, as well. Literally, we have been using U.S. taxpayer dollars to help fund them. I introduced this amendment because the Biden administration has not been transparent about who it has been meeting with, and frankly, I believe this administration has not been honest with the American people about its desire to ban gas stoves. In February of this year, it was widely reported that a government watchdog group obtained information through the Freedom of Information Act revealing a private meeting between the Secretary of Energy and a group that would be covered by this amendment. In particular, this group has been on the forefront of the effort to ban gas stoves. Unsurprisingly, when I sent a letter to Secretary Granholm in February, inquiring whether she was aware of this group's ties to China and the extent of their influence on the Department, I received a letter back that was completely ignoring my questions and concerns. I have to give you a little bit of perspective, Mr. Speaker. My family has been involved in construction for over three generations, and I fully understand the needs that people have at various levels in their homes and their businesses. I mean, we are talking about gas stoves today. Don't get me wrong. There is nothing inherently wrong with electric stoves. That oftentimes fits very nicely--same thing with electric base heat or water heaters, et cetera. There are certain regions of the country, like in Michigan and the upper Midwest, where we are very dependent on propane and natural gas. We don't have the electric grid to support an expansion of that. I know the other side will say that nobody is going to pull your stove out of your house--yet. Nobody is doing anything other than just stoves--yet. We know that places like California, New York, and even in Michigan, the city of Ann Arbor, have gone in and literally banned the addition of and use of gas stoves. They are looking to expand that. They have talked about that. The real rub here, Mr. Speaker, is that we have a major problem with questionable groups with established connections to China. They have those established connections, but we are not sure what their unanswered intentions might be. They are succeeding in influencing policy to limit affordable appliance options for Americans. When President Biden or Senate Majority Leader Schumer are telling the American people that no one is going after their stoves, they may be technically correct today, Mr. Speaker. In the broader picture, we know that that may be coming. I have to say that it is one thing for elected officials to be going after a particular appliance or source of energy, but we have a real problem when Washington bureaucrats, unelected bureaucrats, aren't being honest about their end goal, and they are the ones making the rules and regulations. A ban on gas stoves is going to cost the taxpayers. It is going to cost hardworking, honest Americans more when they are already in an inflationary heightened situation. That is why I wanted to bring this amendment. I appreciate the author's acceptance of this and understanding of where we are trying to go with this. At the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, my amendment is simply to bring an added dose of transparency, expose connections to the CCP, which I truly, honestly believe that both sides of the aisle have concerns about the tentacles of the CCP and the Chinese Government and the influence that it has gained here in the United States. That is why, on the Financial Services Committee that I serve on, we have done CFIUS reviews, which is making sure that it is property and technology and other things that we are protecting from our adversaries like China. Why would we hand over the keys to this particular kingdom? I don't understand. We need to let the American people know who is truly influencing our government and that exposure is there. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time."

              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 342, the Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2023 introduced by my friend, Representative Obernolte. H.R. 342 is a good-government bill that does exactly what it says it will: it improves accountability. When making awards, the Department of Energy is subject to cost-share requirements for most research, development, demonstration, and commercial application activities. DOE can modify or eliminate those requirements when necessary, an authority which has been critical to supporting and developing new technologies. This bill is very simple. It requires DOE to submit a quarterly report to Congress describing the instances where they have modified or waived those cost-share requirements. The bill also makes those reports publicly available. H.R. 342 doesn't prevent DOE from waiving cost-share requirements. It just ensures that those decisions are made public. This transparency and accountability is important because it allows us to ensure we are making the best possible use of taxpayer resources. It is a smart, bipartisan policy. I thank Representative Obernolte and Representative Foster for working on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I rise in support of H.R. 342--``The Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2023.'' H.R. 342 requires the Department of Energy to report quarterly to Congress on the use of the department's authority to reduce or eliminate cost-sharing requirements for various research, development, and demonstration projects. Specifically, this bill aims to establish the necessary requirements to effectively set the standards for quarterly reporting to Congress in order to ensure proper management of capital allotment between energy departments. Mr. Speaker, The Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 2005 (Public Law 109- 58), the underlying statute of H.R. 342 which provides the background history for H.R. 342, calls for the development of grant programs, demonstration and testing initiatives, and tax incentives that promote alternative fuels and advanced vehicles production and use. H.R. 342--``The Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2023'' will provide advancements towards energy innovations that will benefit both the state of energy independence of the United States as well as critical energy advancements for the future. The Secretary of Energy has the authority to reduce or eliminate cost sharing requirements for applied research and development as necessary and appropriate. Moreover, the Secretary may reduce cost sharing requirements for demonstration and commercial application activities as necessary and appropriate, taking into consideration any technological risk relating to the activity. Mr. Speaker, based on the S&P Global macroeconomic model completed on January 5th, it is expected that the U.S. real GDP will grow by 0.5 percent in 2023, with economic growth returning after contraction in the first quarter of 2023. In 2024, the estimated real GDP will grow by 1.9 percent, driven primarily by an increase in household consumption. This means that there will be relatively flat economic growth in 2023 resulting in total U.S. energy consumption falling by 0.9 percent in the forecast. However, total energy consumption then rises by 1.0 percent in 2024. This evidence provides us a basis for making sure we have the proper standards in place for effective accounting for key departments performing various research, development, and demonstration projects. As a senior Member of the Budget Committee, I understand the importance of providing clarity and transparency to the American people on the allocation of funds. I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of H.R. 342, ``The Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2023'' so we can provide transparency to the American people while addressing the proper implementations towards efficient allotment of cost-sharing.",
              "I thank my colleague, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas) for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 342, the Cost- Sharing Accountability Act. Mr. Speaker, research and development grants in the field of energy administered by the Department of Energy play a critical role in innovation and energy research in the United States. The administration and awarding of those grants is governed by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Among other things, that act requires the DOE to impose a cost share on the recipients of those grants. That cost share can be as low as 20 percent in the case of research and development grants, or as high as 50 percent in the case of commercialization and demonstration grants. The purpose of this cost share is simple. It is to ensure that the grant recipients also have some skin in the game when it comes to ensuring the success of the grants and the projects that they are bidding on and demonstrating. Several months ago, the Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology held an oversight hearing in which we investigated the occasions on which the Department of Energy had waived those cost-sharing requirements on grants that it had awarded. The DOE has the statutory ability to waive those cost shares under the appropriate circumstances. We wanted to make sure that that authority was being exercised judiciously. Although we found that the DOE was appropriately waiving those cost shares under those circumstances, we were very surprised by the lack of transparency in that process and equally surprised by the difficulty with which the subcommittee had in acquiring the information about how often the DOE was waiving those cost shares. Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 342, is a very simple solution to that problem. It will require the DOE to make quarterly reports to the committees of jurisdiction in both the House and the Senate on the occasions and the circumstances under which it waives cost-share requirements for the grants that it awards. This will enhance Congress' ability to exercise oversight over the DOE. Equally importantly, it will impose greater transparency into this process for the parties that apply for these grants, and it will demonstrate the circumstances under which the DOE would consider waiving those cost-share requirements. Mr. Speaker, this is basic good governance. It is an oversight bill. I hope it is something that we all on both sides of the aisle can support. I thank my cosponsor, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster), for his leadership on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 342."

              "this amendment fails to see that depleting our strategic reserve for nonemergent reasons hurts our ability to help hurricane victims. The Gulf Coast of Texas, District 14, where I am a Member of Congress, suffers all the consequences of hurricanes. We need to have the stability of a strong SPR. America needs that ability. Downplaying the role of domestic supply--as it seems the other side is intent on--guts the legislation in several ways. First, it treats swaps of oil out of the strategic reserve that were not done--were not done--Mr. Speaker, for emergency reasons--as an emergency. For instance, we could lend oil to China for any reason for an indefinite period without a need to explain how we are going to make ourselves whole in the interim, a/k/a, keep our country safe and keep District 14 safe in Texas. This is extremely personal to me. Second, it takes the lawmaking role from Congress and gives it to the executive branch. Mr. Speaker, I have read the Constitution. I don't think the President is supposed to make laws. I think it is supposed to be up to us in Congress. It gives the DOE, the Department of Energy, power to decide whether or not the law takes effect. That is not their role. Finally, even though it conditions the effective date on a finding by the Department of Energy, in no way does it require the Energy Department to make a finding of one way or the other. So this amendment would make this bill worse--absolutely worse. So we would love to see our colleagues say ``no.'' This amendment is not something that we need. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "My good friend from Texas apparently did not understand the prior amendment in terms of its utilization in the time of disasters that his district faces as mine does all the time and many other Americans. So let me indicate as I move to No. 36, this is, again, an effort to help Americans and to address the question of the efficiency of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. My amendment would allow the necessary and routine test drawdowns that occur as part of the work to make sure the reserve can fulfill its function of providing access to the resources on a moment's notice in time of emergencies. Those of us in various parts of the Nation understand emergencies. In keeping with our commitment to addressing the core mission of many of us to reduce emissions, we may need a number of tests. Tests are basic to the core mission of the reserve and often involve numbers of barrels or less being drawn down. The Jackson Lee amendment would provide the provisions of this bill should not be triggered by Strategic Petroleum Reserve tests. The Jackson Lee amendment would ensure that tests can continue without delay or suspension out of concern regarding the requirements of the bill so that this Strategic Petroleum Reserve can stand ready to be able to efficiently address what is needed. I am concerned about the direct attack because the CEO--the President of the United States--in the executive article utilizes his powers to help Americans in the midst of a disaster. I hope that this amendment can be accepted by my friends which says that we have to do due diligence on testing. I understand the authors of the bill have a specific policy objective in mind and believe that the bill will accomplish a narrow policy change. However, I would hope that they believe in efficiency, and the utilization of this Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an efficient manner requires tests and drawdowns if we are going to be ready for emergencies to save lives in a crisis that is either heating or otherwise. Again, let me remind my colleagues that we did not hear a word--a Republican word or a Democratic word--when gasoline prices came down. So the executive branch should have the right, if you will, to make those emergency decisions. But to have the ability to test is a reasonable response to ensuring that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve works well every single day that we need to use it. I ask my colleagues to support Jackson Lee amendment No. 36. I will also finish by saying: Please understand what we are saying. Please know that we understand both the legislation and the need for improvement of the legislation. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support amendment No. 36 Jackson Lee, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "it is interesting to hear the comment that apparently I didn't understand the last amendment. Having grown up on the Gulf Coast of Texas, first, Hurricane Carla, in 1961, I went through that. I think I understand the Gulf Coast of Texas, and I think I understand hurricanes. I have been there a long time. So I have to rise in opposition to this amendment. Why? This amendment fails to see that depleting our strategic reserve for nonemergency reasons could actually hurt our ability to help the American people exactly in those times and those events of a real supply interruption like a hurricane or natural disaster. Lord knows I have lived and been through a lot of them. This amendment would jeopardize Americans' energy security and energy jobs in several ways. First, it actually creates a loophole to allow ``test sales,'' Mr. Speaker, of oil out of the strategic reserve to be exempted even when it is not an emergency like we talked about on the Gulf Coast of Texas, my home area. How do we know this? History teaches us a valid lesson. For instance, under this amendment, the Biden administration could abuse its authority by using, again, a ``test sale'' to fund a new government program just like President Obama did in 2014. Second, again, it takes the lawmaking role of Congress and gives it to the executive branch. I have read the Constitution, too. I have read the Constitution. It gives the Department of Energy the power to decide whether the law takes effect. That is unbelievable to me, Mr. Speaker. Finally, even though it ``conditions'' the effective date on a finding by the Department of Energy, the DOE, in no way--in no way-- does it require the Energy Department to make a finding of one way or the other. We could be stuck in limbo for Lord knows how long. This amendment would make the bill worse, and, indeed, it is a poison pill. For this I urge my colleagues to make a ``no'' vote. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

              "I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this amendment. We have spoken about the link between hard rock minerals and national security today, but there is one resource highlighted by this amendment that must be discussed, and that is uranium. Domestic uranium is essential for national security, given its role in nuclear deterrence and empowering the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. Uranium also supports the United States biomedical community because it is vital to the production of medical isotopes. As the gentleman has pointed out, the majority of our uranium supply comes from Russia and former Soviet Bloc countries, unfortunately. We have ample deposits of uranium here in the United States. We just have to mine it and process it, and we need to use more of it to create more nuclear power. I thank the gentleman for bringing this amendment. I support it.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1042, the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act. Our imports of Russian nuclear fuel date back to the megatons for megawatts disarmament program at the end of the Cold War. That program has been over for a decade now, and we have developed a dependence on Russian uranium. Our Nation's nuclear reactors currently depend on Russia for nearly 15 percent of their enriched uranium. This is troubling because over the last 2 years we have seen how Russia tries to wield its energy resources as a weapon. It is simply unsustainable. I support ending our dangerous reliance on Russia for enriched uranium, but if we are serious about energy security, we cannot simply switch one foreign dependence for another. That is why we must invest in our own uranium fuel cycle here at home. Right now, we have limited fuel facilities to provide the nuclear fuel our existing fleet needs, much less the advanced fuels that future reactors will need. Any move we make to end our reliance on Russian uranium must be partnered with a build-out of our domestic uranium supply chain. Otherwise, any action would just increase cost to consumers and impact reliability. That is why in committee, Democrats attempted to partner this bill with authorizations to the Department of Energy to invest in U.S. domestic enrichment and conversion capacity. Unfortunately, those efforts were initially rejected by our Republican majority, therefore, I opposed this bill at that time. Fortunately, the committee has now advanced legislation that authorizes those investments in our domestic fuel cycle, and that language will be included in the final defense authorization bill. With that legislation set to become law, I am now much more comfortable moving this bill. After passage of the defense authorization bill, we must ensure these important programs are funded at the levels authorized so we can finally end our dangerous reliance on Russian uranium. The combination of banning imports of Russian uranium and investing in domestic capacity will provide private industry with both the certainty and the incentives it needs to invest in the nuclear fuel supply chain. This will help us become a world leader again, not just in fuel production for our current reactors, but in fuel production for the next generation of reactors, as well. I urge support for this bill, Mr. Speaker. I ask that we support this bill on a bipartisan basis. It is a good bill at this point, and we want to get it to the Senate as quickly as possible. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 1042, the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act, which I introduced with Mr. Latta. American leadership in nuclear energy and nuclear technology is critical to our economic and national security. One of the most urgent security threats America faces right now is our dangerous reliance on Russia's supply of nuclear fuels for our nuclear fleet. This threat has intensified as a result of the war in Ukraine. American nuclear fuel infrastructure has been stunted by policies that Russia has exploited by flooding the U.S. market with this cheaper fuel. Today that accounts for more than 20 percent of our nuclear fuels for American reactors. Last year alone, our industry paid over $800 million to Russia's state-owned nuclear energy corporation, Rosatom and its fuel subsidiaries. That number could be even higher this year, and these resources are no doubt going towards funding Putin's war efforts in Ukraine. Further, we have seen how Putin has weaponized Europe's reliance on Russian natural gas. There is no reason to believe that Russia wouldn't do the same with our nuclear fuel supply if Putin saw an opportunity. Rosatom has also supported China's nuclear energy ambitions. The risks of continuing this dependence on Russia for our nuclear fuel are simply too great. It is weakening America's nuclear fuel infrastructure, which has significantly declined because of the reliance on these cheap fuels. That is why I am leading H.R. 1042. Our bill bans fuel imports from Russia and sends a strong signal to the market that will help ensure America's nuclear leadership and fuel infrastructure. Our legislation also provides waivers to cover any supply gaps leading up to 2028, at which point no more Russian fuel will be allowed to be imported into the U.S. This bill both protects any short-term needs of the industry and provides the long-term certainty necessary to build out American capacity, as well as European capacity that serves our markets. H.R. 1042 has bipartisan support from the Committee on Energy and Commerce. It also has support from the nuclear industry, the nuclear fuels industry, and policy advocates. Additionally, the Biden administration has also said that a ban on Russian fuels is necessary to advance our domestic fuel build-out, including the fuels for advanced reactors. Across Europe, utility providers are starting to transition away from Russian fuels, announce new capacity, and invest in plant projects. We are seeing important fuel processes returning online in the United States. For example, the uranium conversion facility in Metropolis, Illinois, has restarted operations for the first time in years. That facility alone could meet the domestic uranium conversion needs within 2 years, but only if they have assurances that cheap Russian fuel won't undercut their business. The reality is, no facility owner is going to be able to invest to expand production capacity without the certainty of long-term contracts for their products. Those long-term contracts from fuel customers, the utility companies, will not be written if there remains uncertainty about Russian fuel continuing to flow into the United States, and the risk that Russia will once again be able to flood the market with cheaper products. H.R. 1042 provides those assurances to industry. American leadership in nuclear energy and nuclear technology is critical to our economic, energy, and national security, and a strong domestic nuclear fuel system, from mining to enrichment, is vital to our leadership. In the U.S. alone, nuclear energy provides nearly 20 percent of our electricity generation, all of which is emissions free. Nuclear plants operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, making them one of the most reliable, zero-carbon, baseload energy resources. H.R. 1042 will protect the short-term needs of the nuclear industry and provide the long-term certainty necessary to encourage investment and secure a durable domestic supply of fuel. I urge my colleagues to support the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act to restore our industry and take down Russia's nuclear fuel empire. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "I rise today in support of H.R. 21. House Republicans are taking our next step to protect the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and put American energy dominance back on track. First, we are going to stop selling a national security tool to China, and second, we are going to leverage our domestic natural resources to protect against emergency supply disruptions. The President's decision to exploit the SPR to cover up his own energy crisis was nothing short of a political stunt, and I heard that word used when I first walked in. After draining 40 percent of our reserve, the President has left Hoosiers in Indiana's Sixth District vulnerable in the event of a true supply emergency. The SPR is critical to helping respond to natural disasters, hurricanes, or severe supply disruptions. It was never intended to be a solution to the Biden energy crisis facing Hoosiers and all Americans. If the President was truly concerned about high energy prices, he would work with Republicans to support the domestic resources we already have at our disposal. H.R. 21 is a clear, simple way to leverage our assets and refocus the SPR on its original intent, responding to emergency supply disruptions. I look forward to continuing our efforts on the Energy and Commerce Committee to hold this administration accountable and reestablish American energy dominance. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 21, the Strategic Production Response Act. Two weeks ago, this body sent a strong message that we must ensure our Nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve will not advance the energy interests of China over the energy security interests of Americans. This bill today will help ensure this vital American energy asset and American security interests will not be drained away for nonemergency, political purposes. This bill is about restoring America's energy security. It provides a path towards making energy more affordable for Americans who are looking to us to help ease the pain at the pump. H.R. 21 does this by preserving the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for its vital and central purpose: to provide the oil supplies Americans need during true emergencies--emergencies like supply disruptions that threaten the Nation's economy, or the loss of oil production due to hurricanes and other disasters. Put simply, under this bill, if an administration chooses to use the reserve for nonemergency political purposes, it will first have to develop a plan that an equal amount would be reinstated from American energy resources. The SPR should be used as a tool of last resort. This is sensible energy policy. It is also urgent policy. At present, the SPR's ability to protect Americans has been put at risk. More than 250 million barrels of oil, approximately 40 percent of the reserve, has been drawn down in less than 2 years. This is more than all of the former Presidents in history combined. It is all to cover up historically high gas prices in an election year. This is irresponsible. The Biden administration has undermined our Nation's ability to respond to true energy emergencies by mismanaging our Nation's strategic energy stockpile. At the same time, the administration has taken every action to suppress America's mighty energy production abilities. Unbelievably, the Biden administration has turned to Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to pump more oil instead of working to lift their regulatory restraints on American energy producers. America's oil production and refining capacity remains 1 million barrels below peak levels during the prior administration. We have the world's most abundant resources and the capacity to produce millions more barrels per day. America should never be at the mercy of OPEC or Russia. Energy security is economic security and it is national security. It is all connected. It is foundational to everything. We should be unleashing American energy on all fronts. Don't forget, Mr. Speaker, the United States has some of the highest environmental and labor standards in the world. We have been the leader in bringing down carbon emissions. We did this by embracing innovation and our abundant natural resources, not by shutting down entire industries. Right now, America is suffering through the worst energy crisis in decades, and gas prices are still surging upwards. Now, President Biden's and the Democrats' radical rush-to-green agenda has made life unaffordable for people across the country. It has driven up inflation, it has strained household budgets, and it has weakened our electric grid. Gas prices have risen to the highest levels in history. Some have been forced to pay more than $6 a gallon. Gas prices are still 40 percent higher today, and diesel prices are up almost $2 a gallon more than when President Biden took office. It is time to flip the switch. It is time to end the politically motivated abuse of the SPR and focus on American energy and American security. Let's send a strong signal this Congress that we stand for energy security, preserving the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, restoring America's energy dominance, and providing for the prosperity of all Americans. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 21, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "this is a messaging amendment. We saw the President draw down the SPR in order to lower gas prices. That is not the purpose of the SPR. The SPR is not a political tool to be implemented with a drawdown right before an election. This was a blip on the radar for lowering gas prices for our constituents. The SPR was designed for emergencies for this Nation, whether there is a hurricane hitting Louisiana or a war. That is the purpose of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is not just a reserve that the President can tap into to influence elections and lower gas prices for folks. The way to do that is to increase American energy production in this country. We are blessed in this Nation with abundant natural resources, but apparently, we are cursed by liberal politicians who don't want us to tap into those abundant resources that will help the quality of life of people not only in America but by exporting some of those resources to people across the globe, you can improve the quality of lives for people around the world. Yet, we saw a drawdown of the SPR to temporarily lower prices. That was wrong. Emergencies only. When we draw it down, we ought to produce American energy and refill it, not buy oil from OPEC or adversaries using American resources, again, that we are blessed with in this Nation. This amendment will allow the Department of Energy, the administration, to continue abusing something that wasn't intended for that, and that is the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We use SPR; we can call it SPR. We can try to downplay the intended purpose, strategic purposes, to help Americans at a time when it is needed. That is in a time of emergency. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time."

              "I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Speaker, again, in response to the previous speaker who criticized the President, the President successfully used the SPR to lower prices at the pump and provide relief to American families. Now, Republicans want to take away the strategy, which will only result in higher gas prices for Americans. The President's strategy worked, and thanks largely to his actions, gas prices have fallen an average of $1.50 per gallon nationwide since their peak in June. President Biden's actions also made money for American taxpayers. A Wall Street Journal analyst found that the United States made nearly $4 billion in profit from Biden's sale from the reserves, receiving an average of 96 cents per gallon of oil sold from it, well above the current market price of approximately $82 per barrel. The Department of Energy has already announced plans to purchase oil to refill the reserve and will begin making those purchases at a low fixed price later this month. They have actually made money, lowered prices for the American consumer, and are going to be able to fill the SPR at a lower cost. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "frankly, I have no idea why this amendment is being offered. It would force the Department of Energy to ride the roller coaster that is the oil future's market, without any option to just pay a simple fixed price for a barrel of oil. If oil goes up $20 per barrel between when DOE purchases oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and when it is delivered, well, that is too bad. We are now paying $20 per barrel more, and we will have to buy less oil. This amendment unnecessarily restrains DOE and makes purchasing petroleum products to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve more expensive. DOE recognized as much when it issued a rulemaking last fall clarifying that it could purchase oil at a fixed price, as common sense would dictate. There is no reason that it should be illegal for the Department of Energy to sign a contract saying that it will purchase oil for $70 per barrel. No reason that I can think of. Except, of course, if you are an oil company that wants the Department of Energy to pay more to refill the reserve. However, if you are an average American, then this amendment is a raw deal. It constrains the Department of Energy's usage of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is partially responsible for the tremendous over $1.50 per gallon fall in the cost of gasoline we have seen since last summer's peak gas prices. I will note that when the Department of Energy issued its notice of proposed rulemaking this last summer, industry did not object. In fact, the Department of Energy only received one comment on the rulemaking from Employ America, which was unambiguously positive. That comment stated that the rule change ``is an important step to reduce the volatility of oil prices over the short and medium term, improve our Nation's energy security, and a necessary step to ensure that acquisition procedures more fully align with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve's governing statute.'' This amendment will put the usage of index pricing on par with the Department of Energy's duty to acquire petroleum products for the reserve as cheaply as possible. I don't understand that mission. It will only serve to diminish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "my amendment would protect our country and American families in the event of a national emergency by requiring the Department of Energy to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a competitive market rate. We all remember that President Biden chose to tap the SPR for political reasons as he tried to mask his failed energy policies that caused gas prices to soar. When President Biden took office, the average weekly price for a gallon of gas was $2.38. It was already $3.53 prior to Putin invading Ukraine before hitting record highs last summer. Despite depleting our SPR, we still have a weekly average of $3.42. Since draining the SPR to address an energy and inflation crisis of his own making, President Biden and his administration continue to abdicate their responsibility to replenish the reserve. In October 2022, the White House announced it would implement a first-of- its-kind rule establishing a system of fixed-price contracts for replenishing the SPR. Per the administration's policy, they intend to purchase crude oil for the SPR when prices are at or below about $67 or $72 per barrel. The untested fixed-price bid system imposed by the White House has allowed the administration to ignore its responsibility to resupply the SPR to the detriment of the United States' economic and national security. In January of this year, the DOE rejected bids from several producers to refill the SPR because the market rate for crude oil at the time was well above the administration's arbitrary fixed price. This deceptive policy gives the DOE a convenient excuse not to refill the SPR and keep it at record lows, leaving our Nation less safe and prepared. My amendment would remedy this problem by requiring the DOE to use the commonly accepted index-based pricing bid process. Historically, the index-based bid process is used to solicit contracts to refill the SPR and is a standard pricing regime used in the global oil and gas market. Using this more accepted metric, DOE would competitively bid at the market rate for crude oil when buying for the SPR. This bidding system will ensure that DOE will meet its obligations to refill the SPR and not circumvent that obligation with an arbitrary price ceiling. Further, the Federal Government should not be a speculator in the crude oil market. The fixed-price scheme dreamed up by the White House ignores the basic economic realities of how petroleum products are traded in the marketplace. If the administration is concerned about the price of oil not being a good deal for taxpayers, it should end its war on safe and reliable American energy. My amendment would ensure the SPR refill bid process reflects market realities rather than the price mandates of the administration, and restores our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is desperately needed for our national security. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "It is too bad that my Republican colleagues continue to point to Chinese and Russian practices to try to lower the bar for environmental and community protections in our own country. The United States should lead, and we shouldn't set our standards by China or Russia. The American people want their protections, they want clean energy, and they want the process that allows the American people to know and to participate. This bill does none of that. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Casten).",
              "I thank the chairman, Bruce Westerman, for his work. Mr. Speaker, the chairman mentioned something about our last speaker from Pennsylvania. I am a little concerned. Maybe he didn't have time to read the whole bill because the bill he described is not the bill that is before us. He said somehow this would harm the environment. He was concerned about climate. If this bill passes, global emissions will be reduced. The chairman pointed out that the gentleman before, from the other side of the aisle, from Pennsylvania was criticizing this bill and he talked about the natural gas. I am not sure if the gentleman on the other side of the aisle has done any research or if he knows that American natural gas is 41 percent cleaner than Russian natural gas. It is an interesting little fact. If we had replaced for 1 year just Russian natural gas to Europe, we would have reduced CO2 emissions by more than 200 million tons. So, Mr. Speaker, it really begs the question: Who is the polluter? Those who defend Russia and vote against this bill. It is interesting the people opposing this bill, those I am hearing on the other side of the aisle--China, Russia, and OPEC. It is interesting the friends you keep. Now, let's talk a little bit about this. If you go across this country, Mr. Speaker, it costs too much to heat your home and fill up your car. It cost less an administration ago. Today, more than one-third of all Americans say they have skipped buying food or medicine to pay an energy bill in the last 12 months. We are going to have opportunity this week to make sure that they don't have to do that again if you vote ``yes.'' This is neither affordable nor sustainable. In response, President Biden has paid lip service to the need of more energy production, but this is a public relations stunt. Almost every one of his policies involves penalizing America and empowering China. Now, here are the facts: For years, President Biden and Democrats have attacked energy producers, blocked new leases on Federal land, and ground the permitting process to a halt. Their so-called Inflation Reduction Act included a natural gas tax, a $27 billion climate slush fund. The gentleman on the other side of the aisle from Pennsylvania, he supported taxing the natural gas that is produced in his State and creating a slush fund. Meanwhile, in my home State of California, burdensome environmental laws have led to recurring blackouts and more red tape that raises costs for everything. Rather than increasing production and providing good-paying jobs, California imported more than half of its oil from Ecuador in recent years. The interesting fact here is, when the Democrats took control of California under Governor Gavin Newsom, he reduced the amount of oil produced in California by 20 percent. That was 80,000 barrels a day. That doesn't mean California used 80,000 less barrels; it meant California started paying Putin for 50,000 barrels. They get the majority of their oil from Ecuador, from the Amazon. Instead of producing it in an environmentally sound way in California, we are harming the environment. That is exactly what this bill is able to do--lower global emissions, lower the price of energy, and make the world more secure and safe, because then Putin and Russia is not controlling Europe. Democrats have sent a clear message about their priorities. They are the party of $5 gas, subsidizing Communist China and the never-ending dependence on foreign dictators for minerals we have in America. It was only a few short years ago where America produced more of the critical minerals than China, but as the Democrats would shut down leases, make it harder to open new mines, they moved it to other parts of the world, and not in an environmentally sound way, but by empowering China, making them stronger, and making the price in America higher. Luckily, Congress has the opportunity to change the behavior of Washington by passing the Lower Energy Costs Act. Every Member of this chamber should support it. I understand why Russia and China oppose lower energy costs for America and making America stronger, but I don't understand why Members in this Congress would stand with China and Russia against America. The Lower Energy Costs Act does two important things: One, it restores American energy leadership by repealing unnecessary taxes and overregulation on American energy producers so we can lead the world in providing clean, affordable energy. Two, it makes it easier to build things in America. For example, this bill includes a 2-year time limit on environmental impact statements. It also streamlines the process for lawsuits so that activists can't use the courts to delay projects for years. Ninety years ago, American workers built the Empire State Building in 400 days. That is 13 months. These days, however, even repairing existing structures, just like Lake Isabella Dam in my district, has taken 18 years, and that was only because we were lucky in pushing for it. That is exactly how the Big Government under the Biden administration wants the system to work. Every time we need a pipeline, a road, or a dam, it gets held up on an average of 5 to 7 years and adds millions of dollars in costs for the project to comply with Washington's permitting process. It is too long. It is unaffordable. It is not based on science. It is holding us back. It is time we speed up the time it takes for us to build all kinds of things in America. We could streamline permitting, stop abusive lawsuits, protect the environment, and, importantly, lower the price of energy. This is why the Lower Energy Costs Act is H.R. 1. It signals how important the bill truly is. Mr. Speaker, when the Democrats were in the majority, do you know what their H.R. 1 bill was? Election. Why? They wanted to change the election law to try to guarantee their right to be reelected. You see, they looked after themselves. When Republicans took the majority, our H.R. 1 is about lowering energy costs for all Americans. We think it is important to serve others, not yourself. I get permitting reform isn't for everyone. If you like paying more at the pump, you don't want to make it faster for American workers to build more pipelines. If you are China, you would rather America sit back and let others lead. If you are a bureaucrat, maybe you really do enjoy reading the 600-page environmental impact studies. The rest of America wants lower prices, more cash in their hands, more good-paying jobs in America, and rules that are good for the environment. That is exactly what the Lower Energy Costs Act does. Mr. Speaker, America has the potential to become a true energy superpower. God has blessed us with abundant energy, and we shouldn't have to depend on other countries for our future. In fact, we should make the world dependent on us for energy. The world would be cleaner and safer, and America would be better off. If you want to have a responsible energy policy where America produces more energy, pays less for a gallon of gas, and never again bows to foreign dictators, vote ``yes'' on the Lower Energy Costs Act. Three things will happen when this bill becomes law. Your energy costs will be reduced. You will have more cash to take care of your family, to pay for your medicine, to take your family on vacation. It will reduce global emissions, so environmentally, the world will be a better place. It will make the world a safer place, so no longer does America pay Putin for dirtier oil or gas, so no longer does China control other nations because they control the critical minerals that America will not produce. No longer will we watch, as we watched in the 1930s, countries bound together to create an axis of power. We have now watched China enter the Middle East to bring Saudi Arabia and Iran together. That used to be the role of the American President at Camp David. It is no longer. We do not want to watch our President travel to the Middle East to beg to produce something more when America can produce it here in an environmentally sound way. Mr. Speaker, I know why Russia and China fight this bill so hard. I do not understand why those on the other side of the aisle join with Russia and China. I ask them to join with Americans and make America safe and environmentally sound and the world a more secure place.",
              "Just in rebuttal, my friend and Chairman Bruce Westerman put it best. He said when the Democrats talk about polluters over people, what they are actually referring to is not this bill. It is actually a reference to where we are now, thanks to Democratic reckless and radical policies. Right now, China is actually the largest emitter of CO2. Russian gas is much dirtier than gas from other places around the world, especially the United States where we have cheap, reliable, and clean natural gas. But instead of taking advantage of our God-given resources, Democrats and their reckless, radical policies make us more dependent on these forms of energy that are much dirtier. My good friend from Massachusetts said this bill will drag us back decades. Well, I do want this bill to take us back, not decades, but just to a few years ago when we had a Republican in the White House. Let us not forget that the United States, again, we currently lead the world in CO2 emission reduction, but between 2018 and 2019, the total reported greenhouse gas emissions from large facilities fell nearly 5 percent. Yeah, let's go back. Let's go back to that time. I find the talk about costs somewhat interesting because only in Washington, D.C., only in a place that lacks logic and accountability like Washington, D.C., can future revenue be considered a cost. Think about that. It is considered a cost. The math does not make sense. It is also quite fascinating that my friends across the aisle are now talking about deficits, which in the last 4 years they voted for over $4 trillion of increases to spending. Before I yield to my good friend from Texas, Dr. Burgess, I will point out a real-life example of what happens when we follow far-left, Democratic environmental policies. Often I wish that we had a real-life example that we could talk about in terms of policy, and here we do. It is called Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka, trying to search for a great ESG score to--I don't know, appease globalists, appease the ruling elite, appease woke Wall Street investors--they went for this ESG score and right now they are almost a failed state. Sri Lanka's green new deal, to be clear, was a human disaster. It is an ill-advised national experiment. Let me explain it. They went to organic farming. Organic farming yielded nothing but starvation, poverty, and chaos. President Rajapaksa, with no warning, with no attempt to teach farmers how to cope with change, announced a ban on all synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Again, he was after that ESG score. Ninety percent of Sri Lankan farmers relied on synthetic fertilizers. After the ban, 85 percent of farmers experienced crop loss. The damage done by this organic order was so extensive that the former President had to reverse himself less than 7 months later. Now, let's just bring this to political reality, the goals of the United States, where only 20 percent of electricity is powered by renewable energy, 20 percent renewable, and less than 10 percent of American families own an electric vehicle. By the way, those that own electric vehicles are overwhelmingly people who make over six figures a year. It is not your average Americans who are driving around in Teslas. Yet, the left seeks to unilaterally ban all hydrocarbons and instill these pipe dreams that the U.S. will generate all of its energy through wind and solar. All you have to do is look at California to see what comes next. Last August, Governor Newsom announced that they will ban the sale of gasoline cars by 2035. Just 1 week later, after that announcement, the electric grid was overwhelmed in California, and the State had to ask EV owners to limit when they plugged in their vehicles to charge. So if you ask yourself: Where does the policy of the left lead us? Look no further than to the idiocy of the policy in California and look no further than to the almost failed state of Sri Lanka. That is where these reckless, radical policies will lead the U.S. economy. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), the good doctor, my good friend, and fellow Rules Committee member."

              "The ideas of the Republican Party will do more to reduce global carbon emissions than anything that the Democrats have proposed, especially the legislation they passed in the last Congress that is actually incentivizing foreign production of energy. I remember distinctly President Biden going over and fist-bumping the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. Then, this year, guess what? Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company reported the highest profits ever-- $161 billion, for an oil company. They are the plans that we are putting in place, H.R. 1, that will help the planet. It is not the continued misguided principles that are putting the real polluters, the global polluters, ahead of the people. It is ironic that a Member from Texas would think that producers in Saudi Arabia and Russia and Venezuela are polluting less than the oil producers and the energy producers in the State of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Rosendale).",
              "I thank the ranking member for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the majority's polluters over people act, a massive handout to some of the world's most profitable and most powerful corporations. It is a Big Oil giveaway that would hike the deficit instead of helping families, instead of protecting our planet, and instead of lowering costs for consumers and slashing energy bills. Republicans seem to have just one priority, and that is helping the rich get richer. Through price gouging and war profiteering, Big Oil has doubled their profits to record levels. They are hoarding millions of acres of our public land, and they are using these unprecedented resources to line their pockets. Exxon just announced $35 billion in stock buybacks, and Chevron shareholders are pocketing $75 billion. Yet, what is the Republican plan? It is to triple down on allegiance to Big Oil, give away more Federal land, invite more offshore drilling, unleash more pollution into our water and our air and our land, and leave the taxpayers footing the bill. Climate change is here. We don't have time to wait. Americans know that securing our future means investing in clean energy. Families know their health depends on it; economists know our prosperity depends on it; and the Pentagon knows our national security depends on it. It is only MAGA Republicans who don't understand our future depends on a thriving clean energy economy. Last year, we proudly enacted the largest climate investment in history, and now we are proudly voting ``no'' on the polluters over people act.",
              "Taxpayers should not be a piggy bank for Big Oil to line its pockets. As a taxpayer advocate, I am introducing an amendment to protect our money from Big Oil's greed. Under current law, oil and gas companies get a tax break when they tap into their reserves as part of doing business. This amounts to about a $2 to $3 billion handout each year. Now, as we look to spend taxpayer dollars to replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, corporations are poised to double dip, to profit off the American people. Without a change in policy, polluters get tax dollars once in the form of a government contract and again in the form of a special tax break. As a champion for capitalism, I strongly oppose this corporate abuse. When the Federal Government negotiates a contract with oil companies to buy their product with tax dollars, they do it at a fair price. That is capitalism. But to turn around and then give them a tax break, that is corruption, bought and paid for by the fossil fuel industry, which spends $100 million each year on lobbying. As a consumer protection attorney, I have never met any American-- Democrat, Republican, Independent--who likes to be cheated. Consumers should get what we pay for. Big Oil should not get to double charge taxpayers for the same oil. Many of my Republican colleagues talk about safeguarding capitalism. They stress the importance of protecting tax dollars. A handout to Big Oil is antithetical to these goals. Big Oil shouldn't get a bonus helping of tax dollars after they have received government contracts. I urge all my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to stand up for our capitalist principles, to protect taxpayers, and to adopt this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time."

              "I stand here before you today because the American people are hurting. Over the past few years, they have been forced to cope with skyrocketing costs, a direct result of President Biden's misguided energy policies. With every step the President has taken to restrict domestic energy, from canceling the Keystone pipeline to placing a ban on new drilling, it has become much harder for Americans to make ends meet. Fortunately, Republicans have a solution to this problem that will increase domestic energy production. The United States is home to some of the largest reserves of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. The Lower Energy Costs Act will allow us to tap into these resources so we can drive down the cost of energy and combat the out-of-control inflation that has devastated the American family. Our legislation will increase American energy production, reform our broken permitting process, reverse President Biden's anti-energy policies, and improve the construction of energy infrastructure. H.R. 1 also protects our energy future by boosting production of critical minerals, making us less reliant on our adversaries such as China. Under the leadership of Chair Rodgers, my colleagues and I on the Energy and Commerce Committee have been working to shape policies that will unleash American energy and lower costs for our families. H.R. 1 represents our commitment to fighting for an economy that is strong and a nation that is safe. This bill will help reduce our reliance on foreign oil, which would not only benefit our economy but also strengthen our national security and our safety. The left's dream of a Green New Deal future has turned into a nightmare, and it is time for the President to wake up. With prices nearing record highs, the need to unleash American energy has never been more pressing and important. This body must take immediate action to lower energy costs, fight inflation, and secure our energy future, and this bill will do it. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act.",
              "I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 1, the pollution over people act. This is a bill filled with dangerous, unpopular, and unnecessary policy that will worsen our climate crisis--our existential climate crisis. I am part of a generation who has grown up with the very real fear that, in our lifetimes, we will all experience an unlivable planet, that we will lack breathable air and drinkable water, that our houses will be destroyed again and again in natural disasters, that we will develop asthma and struggle to breathe, and that we will have a shortage of food. Sitting here, I have heard a lot from my colleagues repeating that we need to lower energy costs. My question is: Where are the actions on ensuring that price gouging isn't happening at the pump? This is exactly why energy costs are higher at the pump. I agree, but what about the real costs, the cost of life? What we know is that the cost of not doing anything is far greater than the cost of taking action right now. You might not be the ones paying for it, but future generations will be, and I think a body like ours should be thinking about the future and the present. Many people around the globe are already experiencing these threats. Among them are farmers, farmworkers, coastal communities, and community members who cannot afford air-conditioning costs. I would like to believe that, out of compassion for my generation and our vulnerable communities, Republican Members of this body would come to the table and act in a bipartisan way to protect us from this fate. It is possible to create a green transition so we can preserve jobs and the planet and create a whole new economy, a green economy, with good-paying union jobs for all of our people. We can invest in clean energy and train those working in the oil and gas industries so they can have new, good-paying jobs in fulfilling careers. We can do these things, but right now, my Republican colleagues aren't. H.R. 1 is not about what is right for their constituents, working people, or what is right for the Earth. It is about what is right for oil and gas executives getting rich off polluting our planet. This bill would bring back the defunct Keystone XL pipeline, reversing President Biden's wise executive action that ended it. It rubberstamps new construction of new pipelines. Not only is this bill not informed about what is best for the future, but it looks like they haven't learned from what has happened in the past. This bill requires two new Gulf of Mexico oil lease sites. This is very damaging to my home State of Florida. It has been a tradition for both Democrats and Republicans from Florida to support no offshore drilling in the State of Florida. I am looking forward to seeing all of my Republican colleagues who are part of the Florida delegation voting ``no'' on this bill to keep intact their word. I know one of my colleagues said that this body is about integrity and keeping our word. I look forward to seeing those ``no'' votes. In 2010, the Deepwater Horizon explosion pumped 210 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, polluting more than 1,000 miles of Florida beaches with toxic oil. These literal waves of pollution closed beaches and deprived Floridians and visitors of 10 million beach days on our world-class beaches. The economic impact on our tourist industry was profound. The impact on our seafood industry was catastrophic. No one wanted a meal coming from a poisonous sea. In this bill, Republicans are burying their heads in the oil-covered sand and requiring more oil lease sales in the area. I fear for the health of my community. Florida is in the middle of a climate change crossfire. We have rising seas that are creating higher and more destructive storms. We just had Hurricane Ian last year, the deadliest hurricane in 100 years. Entire communities were completely decimated and wiped out. In Orlando, it caused flooding like we have never seen before, leaving constituents homeless. H.R. 1 comes weeks after the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. This report makes it clear: Continued greenhouse gas emissions will lead to destabilizing global warming, and our own only hope is rapid and sustained reductions in greenhouse gasses. I heard a colleague blame Democrats for emissions. That is also not true, but I am glad to hear he was impassioned about blaming Democrats for increased emissions, which would lead me to believe that he agrees that we have to bring down emissions, which the report also said we have to do in a very quick way so we can have a livable planet. Mr. Speaker, I will vote ``no'' on H.R. 1, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. We can and we must do better than this, not just for us but for future generations. I invite my Republican colleagues to abandon this harmful bill and come to the table to work in a bipartisan way on smart energy policy because the decisions you make today will impact future generations and condemn my entire generation to a lifetime of suffering and put us on a path toward an unlivable future. I hope we will make the right decision.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act. As an engineer, I have learned that no issue is too difficult for American innovation and ingenuity to solve when we honestly identify the problem, develop a sound plan to solve it, and do the hard work to get the results we desire. The truth we all know is America has an energy crisis. Energy is foundational to everything we do, and for the sake of our future, we must solve this problem. Energy prices, in general, have gone up nearly 40 percent in a little over 2 years. High energy costs translate throughout the economy, causing inflated prices for every necessity of life, from the food we eat to the clothes we wear to the roof over our heads. President Biden has said he is working to lower these costs. But his actions are drowning out his words. He has waged war on American producers, shutting down oil and gas leasing, banning mining development in certain areas, and insisting on keeping our Federal regulations permanently stuck in the past. What are we getting in return? We are getting more dependence on the worst polluters in the world while we wreck our own economy sending our wealth and jobs overseas. Our current energy policies favor Putin, the Chinese Communist Party, and despots around the globe over the American people and freedom. Why would our friends across the aisle continue to put the worst polluters, human rights violators, and those who wish us harm above the American people? No more. H.R. 1 is designed to solve our energy crisis. House Republicans are ready to show the world that American energy--not Saudi Arabian, not Venezuelan, not Chinese, or Russian energy--American energy is our future. American mining, American innovation, American processing and refining, American manufacturing, and American infrastructure will lead us out of this energy crisis. H.R. 1 outlines this through a variety of measures. First, it rolls back the Biden administration's oil and gas leasing moratoriums, giving producers certainty to produce resources safely and responsibly right here at home. Next, given the importance of minerals to our national security, clean energy technology, and a host of everyday uses, H.R. 1 shores up domestic supply chains for commodities like copper, lithium, and cobalt, and allows us to make our energy infrastructure where it should be made--right here at home in the United States. Every ounce we produce here is an ounce less we and our allies are forced to purchase from Chinese-controlled mines with deplorable labor and environmental standards. And, of course, none of this is possible without modernizing the Federal regulations that delay the projects we desperately need. If you don't believe permitting reform is needed, maybe you will believe President Biden's senior adviser, John Podesta, who recently said: ``We can move faster by setting tighter deadlines for agencies to complete environmental reviews. We can move smarter by making it easier to approve projects with low environmental impact . . . But Congress needs to do its job . . . So it is time to get back to work and pass permitting reform legislation.'' We are called to be good stewards of our resources and leave them better than we found them. That is the definition of conservation. We cannot say our global resources are better off today under Democratic policies. China is building coal plants at a rapid pace, using slave labor to construct solar panels and develop critical minerals, while Russia is not only one of the worst environmental catastrophes on the planet, but they are also using their energy revenues to fund their war in Ukraine. We cannot continue to turn a blind eye to these injustices and say, ``not in my backyard.'' America drills, mines, builds, and innovates cleaner, safer, and more responsibly than anywhere else in the world. Before American innovators and workers can solve our energy problems, we need a plan. H.R. 1 is the plan to solve our energy crisis. For these and many more reasons, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Lower Energy Costs Act. H.R. 1 is the blueprint to ease the burden of this self-inflicted energy crisis on American families. H.R. 1, when executed, will make the United States more secure and competitive on the global stage. Ultimately, H.R. 1 will improve the health and longevity of our natural resources, create a better climate, and spur economic growth and jobs--these are results we should all get behind. Mr. Speaker, you don't have to be an engineer to solve this energy problem. I urge all of my colleagues to join with me and vote a resounding ``yes'' in support of H.R. 1. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on the Budget, Washington, DC, March 20, 2023. Hon. Bruce Westerman, Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Westerman: I am writing regarding H.R. 1335, the Transparency, Accountability, Permitting, and Production of American Resources Act, which was ordered reported by the Committee on Natural Resources on March 9, 2023. The bill contains provisions that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget. In order to expedite House consideration of H.R. 1335, the Committee on the Budget will forgo action on this bill. This is being done with the understanding that it does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in H.R. 1335 or similar legislation and that the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that the Committee may address any remaining issues that fall within its jurisdiction. The Committee on the Budget also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation and requests your support of any such request. I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 1335 and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in your committee report and in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 1335. Sincerely, Jodey C. Arrington, Chairman, Committee on the Budget."

              "I thank Chairwoman Rodgers for yielding me time. I rise in support of H.R. 21, an important and timely bill, and I am proud that the new Republican majority made this one of our first priorities. In less than 2 years, President Biden has drained our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, putting American energy security at risk. Thankfully, House Republicans have a plan to address the issue, replenish our reserve, and unleash American energy. The President's energy policies have hurt Americans, and I thank my colleague on the other side of the aisle. He is correct. In releasing oil from the SPR, it may have helped to lower gasoline prices; however, it uncloaked the lie that it was price gouging from oil companies that caused prices to rise to begin with. More supply was needed, that was obvious, and this administration's policies had constrained domestic production and supply. Approximately 40 percent of the SPR has been drawn down since President Biden took office, with no plan to replenish it. Instead of working together to address the issue, the President has, indeed, chosen to peddle a false narrative about our efforts. The President claims our bill, the Strategic Production Response Act, would limit the administration's access to the SPR. This is blatantly false. Our bill specifically reinforces a President's ability to tap the SPR if an energy emergency is declared. Our bill would, however, require the Department of Energy to prepare a plan to encourage domestic production if the SPR is tapped without a declared energy emergency. While we may accept the seriousness of climate change, we do not accept that U.S. energy transmission and restructuring of the entire industrial base is the solution. Energy security is national security, and failing to increase energy production and replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve puts our country at risk. We need to unleash American innovation and energy production and set our country on a path to energy independence. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 21.",
              "in that letter, Secretary Granholm wrote that by hamstringing the administration, this bill will result in ``more oil supply shortages in times of crisis and higher gasoline prices for Americans.'' The President also recognizes this bill is a bad deal for the American people, and that is why he said that he would veto it if it ever got to his desk. Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record the text of the Statement of Administration Policy. Statement of Administration Policy H.R. 21--Strategic Production Response Act--Rep. McMorris Rodgers, R-WA and 31 Cosponsors The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 21, the Strategic Production Response Act. The bill would significantly weaken a critical energy security tool, resulting in more oil supply shortages and higher gas prices for working families. This Administration's use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has been essential to protecting our energy security and to lowering gas prices for Americans. Following Putin's further invasion of Ukraine last year, President Biden authorized the largest-ever emergency release from the SPR, in coordination with historic releases from allies and partners. The results speak for themselves: today, gasoline prices are $1.60 per gallon lower than their peak this summer and below their pre-invasion levels. That was far from a foregone conclusion: the Treasury Department estimates that SPR actions reduced prices at the pump by as much as 40 cents per gallon. If enacted, H.R. 21 would significantly weaken America's ability to take such decisive action to increase supply and lower prices in times of crisis. Putin has tried to use energy supply and high prices as a strategy to weaken the United States and Europe's resolve to defend Ukraine. By interfering with the United States' ability to release, oil collectively, this legislation would help Putin's war aims. In addition, H.R. 21 would severely restrict the Administration's ability to increase oil supply and prevent price spikes in response to natural disasters or pipeline outages-as Administrations of both parties have done. By arbitrarily requiring completion of a report related to energy production on Federal lands, H.R. 21 makes it harder to provide relief to Americans during energy disruptions globally and at home. Moreover, there is nothing currently standing in the way of domestic oil production. Production is up by more than 1 million barrels per day under President Biden and is on track to reach a new record this year. Oil and gas companies are currently sitting on thousands of unused but approved permits that they can use to further increase production right now. Because H.R. 21 will jeopardize our energy security and increase gas prices for working families, the Administration strongly opposes the bill. If Congress were to pass this bill, the President would veto it.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 21, the Strategic Production Response Act. Two weeks ago, this body sent a strong message that we must ensure our Nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve will not advance the energy interests of China over the energy security interests of Americans. This bill today will help ensure this vital American energy asset and American security interests will not be drained away for nonemergency, political purposes. This bill is about restoring America's energy security. It provides a path towards making energy more affordable for Americans who are looking to us to help ease the pain at the pump. H.R. 21 does this by preserving the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for its vital and central purpose: to provide the oil supplies Americans need during true emergencies--emergencies like supply disruptions that threaten the Nation's economy, or the loss of oil production due to hurricanes and other disasters. Put simply, under this bill, if an administration chooses to use the reserve for nonemergency political purposes, it will first have to develop a plan that an equal amount would be reinstated from American energy resources. The SPR should be used as a tool of last resort. This is sensible energy policy. It is also urgent policy. At present, the SPR's ability to protect Americans has been put at risk. More than 250 million barrels of oil, approximately 40 percent of the reserve, has been drawn down in less than 2 years. This is more than all of the former Presidents in history combined. It is all to cover up historically high gas prices in an election year. This is irresponsible. The Biden administration has undermined our Nation's ability to respond to true energy emergencies by mismanaging our Nation's strategic energy stockpile. At the same time, the administration has taken every action to suppress America's mighty energy production abilities. Unbelievably, the Biden administration has turned to Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to pump more oil instead of working to lift their regulatory restraints on American energy producers. America's oil production and refining capacity remains 1 million barrels below peak levels during the prior administration. We have the world's most abundant resources and the capacity to produce millions more barrels per day. America should never be at the mercy of OPEC or Russia. Energy security is economic security and it is national security. It is all connected. It is foundational to everything. We should be unleashing American energy on all fronts. Don't forget, Mr. Speaker, the United States has some of the highest environmental and labor standards in the world. We have been the leader in bringing down carbon emissions. We did this by embracing innovation and our abundant natural resources, not by shutting down entire industries. Right now, America is suffering through the worst energy crisis in decades, and gas prices are still surging upwards. Now, President Biden's and the Democrats' radical rush-to-green agenda has made life unaffordable for people across the country. It has driven up inflation, it has strained household budgets, and it has weakened our electric grid. Gas prices have risen to the highest levels in history. Some have been forced to pay more than $6 a gallon. Gas prices are still 40 percent higher today, and diesel prices are up almost $2 a gallon more than when President Biden took office. It is time to flip the switch. It is time to end the politically motivated abuse of the SPR and focus on American energy and American security. Let's send a strong signal this Congress that we stand for energy security, preserving the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, restoring America's energy dominance, and providing for the prosperity of all Americans. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 21, and I reserve the balance of my time."

              "let me say that I am happy to see that the gentleman from Michigan admits that the Department of Energy is not banning gas stoves. I keep saying it, but he did say that they are not banning them, at least not yet, he said. I want to stress that the efficiency standards in the Department of Energy rule, again, don't go into effect until 3 years after the rule is finalized. Even though my colleagues keep saying that we are banning gas stoves and talk about the efficiency standards and how they have to get rid of them with this legislation, keep in mind that these efficiency standards don't even go into effect for another 3 years after the rule is adopted. Again, we are not banning gas stoves, just talking about efficiency standards. There is also the claim that has been put out there by the Republicans that 96 percent of gas stoves on the market today don't meet the proposed DOE standard, and that is just not true. The statistic that is mentioned by our colleagues on the other side is a specific test of high-end models that the Department of Energy anticipated would not meet the standard, meaning one of the tests conducted by DOE was deliberately designed to focus on models that would need upgrades to meet the standard. This test was not designed to represent the whole market. According to DOE, and you can look at what they have put out, about half of the market already meets the proposed energy conservation standard, including all entry-level models at this time. Again, you can keep your gas stove. We are talking about efficiency standards in 3 years, not now. As to the amendment before us, which I oppose, it amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act with vague language that would likely be impossible to implement. Additionally, this amendment is clearly designed to target environmental and clean energy groups. If this amendment is adopted, and if H.R. 1640 becomes law, it would slow down the Department of Energy rulemaking process and create additional burdens to adopting energy conservation standards. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to recognize that this amendment is pure Republican messaging and would hinder climate action. I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I can't even believe we are at this moment where the administration wants to take your gas stove--not take your gas stove but limit what you can purchase in the future. I rise in support of H.R. 1640, the Save Our Gas Stoves Act. It is no secret this administration has waged war on American energy. From day one, President Biden has waged war on American energy, doing everything possible to phase out the use of all fossil fuels, including American-produced oil and clean-burning, American-produced natural gas. Now, they are taking it a step further. They are dictating what appliances Americans can purchase for their homes. In February, the Department of Energy announced a new proposal that would ban most natural-gas-fueled stoves on the market today. According to DOE's evaluation, only 4 percent of the gas stove cooking tops tested would meet DOE's proposed standard. DOE's proposed regulation would render gas stoves almost completely unavailable to the American consumer. The average annual savings under the proposed rule would be only about $1 over the average lifetime of the appliance--$1 a year. We are debating a proposed rule that would save Americans, on average, $1 a year over the life of the appliance? Mr. Speaker, we have a lot more to do in this United States Congress than debating a proposed rule that will limit Americans' choices for appliances that would only save them $1 a year. This clearly does not achieve the significant savings of energy as the law, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, requires. So, what is this all about? I will tell you what it is about, Mr. Speaker. The Democrats and this administration hate fossil fuels, and they want to diminish Americans' standard of living. This rule is illegal, and it should be withdrawn. It is not a sincere effort to improve efficiency but rather a part of the whole-of- government approach to target energy sources they ideologically oppose. H.R. 1640, the Save Our Gas Stoves Act, which we are debating today, would prohibit the Secretary of Energy from finalizing, implementing, or enforcing the recently proposed rule. It would also prohibit the Department of Energy from reissuing a rule that bans the use of natural gas. Their goal is to end natural gas in this country. Natural gas is what got us down to the carbon emissions levels that we have achieved. If you want to approach it from the climate change standpoint, the carbon emissions standpoint has been because of natural gas. It would also prohibit the Department of Energy from reissuing a rule. It would clarify that DOE does not have the authority to remove cooking products from the market simply because of the fuel product that the appliance consumes. I am a proud cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation, and I thank Congresswoman Lesko for her leadership on this and for introducing this bill. Americans should be free to choose the cooking products they use in their homes and their businesses, and this bill ensures that. Households that use natural gas for heating, cooking, and clothes drying save an average of $1,068 per year compared to homes that use electricity for those appliances. The rush to green and mass electrification efforts pursued by the Biden administration are costing Americans and making everyday life more expensive, all for $1 per year savings. It is gas stoves today. It will be gas furnaces tomorrow. They are already talking about gas hot water heaters and then dryers. They are coming after your natural gas appliances because they hate natural gas. The bottom line is that, on day one, President Biden said that we are going to end the use of fossil fuels. He wanted to ban fracking, offshore production, and onshore production. That is the real reason we are debating this. It is not about the appliance. It is about the war on energy and American-produced energy. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that is in front of us today which prioritizes American energy affordability and reliability and that puts the American people first and gives them choices. Let the market determine which choice they can have, and let the consumer choose which one best meets their needs for their family, for their households, and for their businesses as they look at the bottom line in their budgets because the intention of the proposed rule only saves American families $1 a year. Give me a break. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1640.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1640, the so-called Save Our Gas Stoves Act. This is a Republican messaging bill designed to deliberately mislead the American people about gas stoves. Let's set the record straight with a little reality. The Biden administration is not, and I repeat, not banning gas stoves. This is nothing but a political stunt. House Republicans continue to put politics over people. With this bill today, they are once again putting polluters over people. H.R. 1640 is designed to prevent the Department of Energy from finalizing a recently proposed energy efficiency standard for electric and gas stoves and cooktops that would lower energy bills, improve Americans' health, and cut pollution. DOE energy efficiency standards are extremely popular. A recent poll found that three out of five Americans support stricter energy efficiency standards for appliances and buildings. The proposed DOE rule that Republicans are trying to prevent from moving forward is a commonsense standard. The claim that 96 percent of gas stoves on the market don't meet the proposed DOE standard is just not true. Mr. Speaker, 50 percent of the market already meets the proposed standard, including all entry-level models. More importantly, the proposed standard only applies to new gas stoves manufactured and sold 3 years after the rule is finalized. That would give manufacturers more than enough time to meet these new standards. There is simply no reason for this proposed rule to be controversial. No one is saying you can't keep your gas stove. No one is saying you don't have a choice. No one is saying you have to move to electric stoves. This is all misinformation. Rather than acknowledging the facts, Republicans are instead employing their usual scare tactics, putting politics over people. Despite what you hear from my Republican colleagues today, the DOE rule does not ban gas stoves, does not remove gas stoves from homes, and does not prevent anyone from putting a gas stove in their home. This rule only applies to new stoves, and, as I said, manufacturers have 3 years to meet the standard. Mr. Speaker, I am sorry I have to keep repeating it, but I know the other side keeps repeating the misinformation. All this means is that if a consumer goes to buy a new gas stove in 3 years, it will be more energy efficient and cheaper to operate. That is a win for consumers, our health, and our ongoing fight to combat the worsening climate crisis. Mr. Speaker, to make it worse, Republicans are not just going after this energy efficiency standard. Since the bill does not include a sunset clause, it could forever limit the Department of Energy from taking substantive action to improve energy efficiency of cooktops. This is just another way Republicans are continuing to prop up their polluter friends. This bill as well as the REINS Act, which is on the floor later this evening, show that Republicans are skeptical of everything agencies do, including all rulemakings and regulations. Republicans think that they can do the math, conduct the analysis, and reach conclusions better than the subject matter experts at our Federal agencies. That is not how our government works. We hire agency experts to make the best decisions and do their jobs best. The Department of Energy rulemaking process is detailed and well researched, with ample opportunity for public engagement. Commonsense energy efficiency standards save everyday Americans money and reduce emissions. These standards are popular, and cooktops that meet the standard are already available on the market. Republicans claim to care about energy prices, but this Republican bill prohibits the Department of Energy from finalizing a rule that can save consumers up to $1.7 billion. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1640 should be rejected so that the Department of Energy can proceed with its commonsense energy efficiency standards. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the balance of my time."

              "I rise in opposition to H.R. 1, the Polluters Over People Act. While it claims to lower American energy costs, it would directly result in policies that would cost taxpayers billions in environmental costs. Congress should not pass laws that benefit oil, gas, and mining companies at the expense of our public lands and public health. I have worked diligently to conserve and protect our public resources, and ensure the federal government is a good steward of our public lands. This bill would severely cut the opportunity for communities to participate in the environmental review process of a project. It also fails to recognize tribal sovereignty; the U.S. federal government must honor its trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribal nations. H.R. 1 ignores the fact that oil and gas companies have made billions in profits while Americans suffered under high prices at the pump during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. This bill would lower royalty rates and repeal interest fees to these companies, further lining their pockets while reducing the money the government receives for use of these lands. Public lands are just that: they belong to the people--not to major corporations. Members of Congress have a responsibility to be good stewards of these resources. Additionally, many mining companies are foreign-owned, like Antofagasta, the parent company of Twin Metals. That company's proposed sulfide-ore copper mine would put our public lands and waters at great risk of toxic mining pollution. After extraction, Antofagasta would ship our American minerals overseas to China for smelting and to be sold in the global market. How is it in our national interest to re- purchase our own mined materials? The rush to pass this legislation is a national security issue. Safeguards must be put into place when minerals are harvested from public lands--they should not be used to put the integrity of those lands or our national security at risk. Our laws need to be updated, including meaningful permitting reform to facilitate the green energy transition. That is why Democrats included $1 billion in the Inflation Reduction Act for federal agencies to more quickly and efficiently process permits. But H.R. 1 does not work with agencies to address permitting backlogs. Instead, it slashes environmental regulations and imposes arbitrary time limits on reviews. Permitting reform and updated regulations must be done responsibly, with good-faith participation from local communities, as well as a strong emphasis on equity, environment impacts, and public health. I am happy to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make this happen, but H.R. 1 is not the avenue to do so. Mr. Speaker, let me be clear: H.R. 1 is an attack on our public lands, which belong to Minnesotans and all Americans. It should be rejected.",
              "I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 21, which would prevent increased drilling on Federal lands under this act until the Secretary of Energy certifies that it would not perpetrate environmental injustice. Let me just thank, first of all, Ranking Member Pallone for his leadership and support in advancing this amendment. My amendment is very simple. It prohibits increases in the percentage of Federal lands leased for oil and gas production under this act, if that new drilling would perpetuate environmental injustice. Environmental justice is the right to a safe, healthy, productive, and sustainable environment for all, regardless of race, class, income, or background. For too long, we have overlooked the impact of environmental issues on underserved communities in this country. EPA data shows that people of color are much more likely to live near polluters and breathe polluted air. For instance, asthma, which is often caused by a particular pollution, impacts approximately 13.4 percent of African- American children, compared to only 7.3 percent of White children. But all low-income people and communities, and especially in poor communities, all communities deserve to be safe from environmental health impacts, and people of all races confront environmental injustice. Rural communities are also adversely impacted by mining pollution and contaminated air and groundwater. Environmental injustices impact all of us; from urban centers to rural regions. In my home State of California, we are experiencing the climate emergency firsthand. We know that these unprecedented fires are driven by climate change. Preventing harmful oil and gas drilling, especially when it harms those already most vulnerable, will help get us back on the path to justice. This amendment builds off of the A. Donald McEachin, our beloved late colleague, his Environmental Justice for All Act, that I am proud to co-lead with Ranking Member Grijalva, which sets the stage to begin addressing the long history of environmental racism and injustice in the United States. Mr. Speaker, this fight for environmental justice is also very personal for me. I was born and raised in El Paso, Texas, under the shadow of the smokestacks of the Asarco copper smelter. Myself, my friends, my neighbors, we were constantly exposed to toxic chemicals. I watched so many people close to me, including family members, suffer with major health challenges because of lead that spewed from that plant. In the 1970s, the CDC found that 62 percent of children under 10 living near the plant where I lived had toxic levels of lead in their blood. Even after the smelter was shut down, I think it was, like, 2013, it took decades before any of the residents harmed saw any sort of justice. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article titled: ``Before Flint, Before East Chicago, There Was Smeltertown.'' [From NRDC, Nov. 29, 2016] Before Flint, Before East Chicago, There Was Smeltertown (By Lauren Villagran) After a 1970s CDC study showed that the mostly Mexican- American population of this Texas town had dangerously high blood lead levels, its buildings were demolished and its residents were booted. The Smelter Cemetery sits high atop a desert arroyo between Interstate 10 and the Mexican border in El Paso. Its wind- worn wooden crosses are almost all that remain of a community that sprang up more than a century ago next to an Asarco lead smelter on the banks of the Rio Grande. The stone-pile graves bear testament to the history of this place called Smeltertown. At one time it was a village of more than 2,500 people, most of them Mexican immigrants who built their lives on company land in the shadow of the smelter's smokestacks that would poison their air, their land, and their children. And almost as soon as the contamination became known in the 1970s, the community of Smeltertown was erased: its buildings demolished, its people forced out. Now, the men and women who lived and worked in Smeltertown, their children, and their children's children reunite each year. Many still live in El Paso, in neighborhoods that cropped up as Smeltertown was torn down. Others travel from California, the East Coast, and abroad. They come together to reweave the social fabric of Smeltertown by sharing memories and retelling stories they all know by heart. They celebrate their old hometown despite the dangers it posed to their families. Seminal research done on Smeltertown in the 1970s by the Centers for Disease Control found that 62 percent of children 10 and under living within one mile of the smelter had blood lead levels considered to be ``evidence of undue lead absorption.'' The residents of Smeltertown would be the first American community to face the grim prospect of lead exposure and its consequences--but they wouldn't be the last. The communities of Flint, Michigan, the West Calumet Housing Complex in East Chicago, Indiana, and the schools in Newark, New Jersey, are just three of the most recent examples. But the CDC estimates that at least half a million children in the United States have elevated blood lead levels--and many of them may not even know it. A Company Town The American Smelting and Refining Company owned a smelter in El Paso that, starting in 1910, refined hundreds of thousands of tons of lead and copper harvested from its mines in Mexico. It did so with the help of ``an army of Mexican contract workers,'' according to University of Houston associate professor of history Monica Perales in her book Smeltertown: Making and Remembering a Southwest Border Community. Mexican workers who labored in Asarco mines began migrating north, lured by that new operation on the U.S. side of the border. Many settled on company land below the foothills of Mt. Cristo Rey. In the early years of the 20th century, Smeltertown lay outside El Paso city limits, a few miles from the city's downtown. Divided into an upper section, El Alto, where the Anglo managers lived, and a lower section, El Bajo, where the Mexican workers lived, Smeltertown had its own post office, butcher shop, bakery, cantinas, a theater, San Jose Catholic parish, a YMCA, a public elementary school, and the Smelter Vocational School. Smeltertown was a quintessential company town, in which the company could be both benefactor and tyrant. Former residents say Asarco paid well, better than many other employers of the working class. And yet poverty in Smeltertown could be extreme. Residents built and invested in their homes, but the company owned the land; few families could afford cars; many relied on outhouses into the 1960s. ``As in other single- industry towns, Smeltertown's residents fashioned their own way of life in the world the company made, one marked by inequality, racial segregation, and corporate paternalism,'' Perales writes. The community would flourish for 70 years under the plumes of the smelter's twin smokestacks, ignorant of the pervasive danger. ``A Silent Poison'' In March 1971, a team of Epidemic Intelligence Service officers from the CDC arrived to investigate lead exposure connected to the Asarco smelter. Dr. Bernard Rosenblum, the El Paso City-County health commissioner, had called the CDC after his department discovered that Asarco was discharging large quantities of lead and other metallic wastes into the air. Between 1969 and 1971, the smelter's stacks had spewed more than 1,000 tons of lead, 560 tons of zinc, 12 tons of cadmium, and 1.2 tons of arsenic into the atmosphere. Soil studies showed the highest concentrations of lead and other metals in surface soil closest to the smelter--essentially, in Smeltertown. The city of El Paso was suing Asarco on the basis of those findings alone, but Rosenblum wanted to know more. He was worried about the health of the kids. (OnEarth made several attempts to reach Asarco and its parent company, Grupo Mexico, for comment without success.) The CDC team, led by a 29-year-old pediatrician named Philip Landrigan, began to explore a subject about which precious little was known: lead toxicity, especially its effects on children. Landrigan, now a pediatrician and epidemiologist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, says, ``The notion that lead could be toxic at lower levels was extremely new at that time. Up until 1970 and continuing for years, people believed you didn't have to worry about lead unless it was so high that it made a child seriously sick. The whole idea that lead in the body could be a silent poison was a new concept.'' Landrigan and the CDC team first looked at whether environmental contamination would be reflected in human blood lead levels over three months. The results were startling: Although they found no cases of overt lead poisoning, 43 percent of people in all age groups and 62 percent of children 10 and under living within one mile of the smelter had blood lead levels of at least 40 micrograms per deciliter. That's eight times the level at which the CDC recommends a full-fledged public health response today. Landrigan quickly followed up with a second study in Smeltertown in 1972, examining the health consequences of lead exposure in children. The CDC team administered IQ tests and a finger-tapping test of physical reflexes to the Smeltertown kids with elevated blood levels; a control group of children with blood lead levels below 40 micrograms per deciliter was also tested. The study found that children with elevated blood lead levels tested as many as seven points lower on the IQ test than the control group; they also showed much slower reaction times on the physical reflexes test.",
              "Throughout this debate, my Democratic colleagues have repeated misinformation and engaged in fearmongering as a tactic to convince American families to submit to their green agenda and just accept more expensive and less reliable energy as the new normal to undermine our economy, make the cost of living even higher, and, perhaps even more troubling, severely undermine our national security. Apparently, my Democratic colleagues are okay with making China great again at the expense of the American people and the rest of the world. I heard the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, my colleague--again, who I have great respect for--say a few minutes ago: Tell the American people the truth. Well, let's tell the American people some truth. According to a report by the LendingClub, at the end of 2022--that is 2 years into the Biden administration--9.3 million more United States consumers were living paycheck to paycheck compared to the prior year. Of that group, 75 percent identified inflation as a reason for their financial situation to be worsening. By the end of 2022, China's oil refining capacity exceeded the United States' oil refining capacity. According to the International Energy Agency's oil market report, U.S. refining capacity is at 17.6 million barrels per day. According to the China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Association, China's capacity is at 18.4 million barrels per day. We are far more dependent on China today for the very rare earth minerals and critical minerals that are needed to pursue the renewable green energy plan that the Democrats are trying to push. You can't get there in the timeframe that they are trying to get there, Mr. Speaker, without becoming more dependent on China. There are those who say that Republicans are climate deniers. That is simply not true. We simply believe that Republicans have better ideas to unleash America's energy and to restore America's energy independence. At the same time that those are good energy policies, they are also good climate policies. Let me give you an example. Everybody says that the goal of addressing the climate problem is to reduce carbon emissions. Mr. Speaker, if that is truly the goal, why do we not want to export more American natural gas around the world? According to the American Exploration and Production Council, if we would simply export four times the amount of natural gas that we are exporting today--which we could do easily because we have got a wealth of it--we could lower carbon emissions more than if we were to electrify every vehicle in America, put a solar panel and a battery backup on the home and the rooftop of every residential home in America, and build 57,000 industrial-strength windmills, all combined. American natural gas is the cleanest form of natural gas on the planet. Our friends and allies in Europe sure wish they had some of that today because they have become dependent on Vladimir Putin for their sources of energy. Look at the Germans, who decided to throttle their nuclear suite and become dependent on Russia for their energy. What did they end up doing? Forest clearing, burning wood to cook their food and heat their homes. We do not want to go the way of Europe. They have already tried all of this. I implore my Democratic colleagues: We are not arguing about the goal. We agree with cleaner forms of energy. What we are arguing about, it appears to me, is the timeframe in which to accomplish that and the amount of money and the change in the quality of life that it is going to require for the American people. I am sure many of you went to college and you studied the business triangle: time, cost, and quality. You can't affect one of those without affecting the other two. With this rush to green, if we want to do this so fast before renewable forms of energy are mature enough technologically to be able to provide the baseload energy for our grid, to put fuel in our automobiles, if we want to do it that fast, it is going to cost a hell of a lot of money, and it is going to change for the worse the quality of life for the American people. H.R. 1 is a commonsense energy package. If you lower energy costs, you are going to lower inflation. If you lower inflation, you are going to allow the American people to keep more of their hard-earned money. When American people keep their hard-earned money, they come up with good ideas, and our economy begins to thrive. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1 is not about politics. It is about the American people. They are sick and tired of people inside the beltway taking and taking and taking while they are always having to do the giving. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 1. It is the right thing to do for the American people. Let's unleash American energy. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

Oil and gas exploration in the Outer Continental Shelf accounts for roughly 15 percent of all domestic oil production and 2 percent of domestic natural gas production. By actually further limiting this vast resource, are they going to bring American energy prices down? No way.

              "this amendment would prohibit the bill from taking effect until the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with other Federal agencies, certifies that this bill will not result in an increase to the average price of energy for Americans. The world's largest supply of emergency crude oil--the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--was established to reduce the devastating impact of supply shocks on prices. When supply shocks are allowed to occur uninhibited, prices rise, and the American people suffer. Whether it is mile-long lines at your local gas station or home energy costs that force families into the cold or heat, supply shocks in energy markets hurt people. They might not hurt some of my colleagues' neighborhoods, but they certainly hurt mine. My constituents would feel deeply the pain that would happen if the President was not permitted to utilize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to do its job. All too often, affording to keep the lights on is an everyday struggle for my constituents and for many other Americans, as well. My district, the Virgin Islands, has among the highest residential and commercial electric rates in the country. The SPR is one of the few mechanisms that the Federal Government has to prevent ever-growing price pressures from crushing people. Less than 1 year ago, in the face of global crude oil instability following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, President Biden acted with great positive effect to make measured drawdowns from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, causing price reductions by as much as 40 cents per gallon at the pump. Today, average gasoline prices are down by more than $1.50 per gallon from their peak last summer. So the utilization of the SPR thus far to release oil into the market has been very effective for American taxpayers. The SPR is a force for good when it is allowed to operate unencumbered. However, this bill would significantly weaken this critical energy security tool and hamstring the President's ability to utilize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a time of disruption, which will result in more oil supply shortages. It would do so by making it harder to withdraw oil into the market quickly to increase supply when the market needs it most--which will drive up gasoline prices. The President must be able to rapidly provide oil from the SPR to address supply disruptions and respond to emergencies. Arbitrarily requiring the completion of reports related to energy production on Federal lands specifically--a matter which the Department of Energy does not control--would only delay response and increase prices when energy disruptions occur. So my amendment is simple. It provides that SPR utilization may not be limited unless the Secretary of Energy certifies that this would not push up average energy prices in America. Nothing is standing in the way of domestic oil production. Oil production is up by 1 million barrels per day under President Biden and is on track to reach a new record high this year. There are nearly 10,000 approved but unused permits to drill. The basic rules of economics must continue to apply. The SPR should continue to serve as a flexible and responsible emergency supply recourse to put down pressure on energy prices. Under my amendment, this bill must not yield the opposite and raise energy prices. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to please approve my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time."

This amendment undermines the purpose of H.R. 21 and would deprive the country of the benefits of secure American supplies of cleanly produced fossil energy. Rather than deprive Californians--including the hardworking Californians in the energy production industry--the benefit of increasing American energy and security, we should embrace the pro- energy policies of H.R. 21.

              "this amendment will prohibit the leasing plan from including a whole new swath of Federal lands. This is a solution in search of a problem because many of these areas are already protected. I went through the list. I don't see any that aren't. Under existing law, many of these places aren't open for oil and gas leasing. Nothing in H.R. 21 would change that fact. President Biden campaigned on a platform to end fossil fuels, and on day one of his administration, he imposed a moratorium on energy production on Federal lands. The Biden administration has leased fewer acres than any other administration dating all the way back to World War II. H.R. 21 will reverse the dangerous precedent set by President Biden and his administration and unlock the natural resources owned by the American people for the benefit of all. The SPR shouldn't be used for political purposes. Drawing down to influence gas prices is wrong when the SPR is set aside for national emergencies, a time of war. It is a strategic asset for the American people, not to be used to influence elections. This amendment will increase gas prices and weaken our energy security by reimposing the Biden administration's leasing moratorium. It is wrong. It is messaging. I get it. You are okay with releasing gas and oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to influence gas prices, weakening our Nation if a natural disaster should strike. We need to replenish the SPR. We need to do it with the American resources that we are blessed with in this country. That is what H.R. 21 does.

              "I can only characterize this amendment as extreme. If adopted, this amendment would make an already reckless bill even more careless and would weaken our national energy security. Now, let me say that I totally disagree with what the gentlewoman just said. First of all, what President Biden has done, as we have said repeatedly today, is to release crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to bring down gas prices. And he actually accomplished that goal. It worked by bringing down prices about a $1.50 per gallon since the peak last June. In addition to that, we have set forth that this was to address the supply chain because we know that with the war in Ukraine, the supply chain was severely limited, and one of the purposes of releasing oil from the reserve was to have more in the supply chain. The gentlewoman also suggested that this administration is restricting the use of public lands for drilling. That is simply not the case. One-half of the public lands are available for drilling. As I have said before, the oil companies simply don't want to drill because they want to keep the prices artificially high. Now, what the gentlewoman has done--and I just want to explain this in a little detail. Right now, the bill before us does have an exemption that says that you don't have to drill or put forth a plan to drill on public lands if certain criteria are met. It says that during a severe energy supply interruption, if the President determines that an emergency situation exists and there is a significant reduction in supply, a severe increase in the price of petroleum products and/or such price increase is likely to cause a major adverse impact on the national economy. So even under this underlying bill, if those criteria are met, then the President can use the SPR and release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for these reasons. What the gentlewoman has done--or tries to do--in this amendment is eliminate those exemptions. So essentially what she is saying--this is why this is so extreme--is she is saying it doesn't matter if there is a problem with high prices. It doesn't matter if there is a problem with the supply chain. We are not going to let the President release oil from the reserve for any reason whatsoever unless a plan is put forward to allow for more drilling on public lands. That is extreme. Even the Republican leadership doesn't support that. She is saying no exemptions whatsoever. Imagine what this would do if we had no flexibility whatsoever no matter what the price was, no matter what the supply was, and no matter what the emergency is, not allowed. You have got to put together a plan which could take years to put forward a way of drilling more on public lands before we would be able to use this tool which is so important for national security. This is really, in my opinion, outrageous and extreme. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to oppose the amendment for this reason, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I see that I have my good friend, Mr. Pallone, over on this side, and I thought I would have my good friend from South Carolina, but now I have my good friend from Texas who is here. I am sure they understand that everyone who comes to the floor is sincere. The gentlewoman from New York and others who have offered their amendments are sincere and factual. They have knowledge. I just want to put that in the Record so that no one's integrity is challenged. I am sincere, and I believe that we need to have a little history lesson as to what the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is all about. It exists first and foremost as an emergency response tool that the President can use should the United States be confronted with an economically threatened disruption in oil supply. It is also where oil can be released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve under exchange arrangements similar to loans to private companies. Exchange contracts provide for a loan of crude oil to be repaid in kind within a certain timeframe and with additional petroleum barrels. However, as we move toward an increasing respect for climate change, I think amendments have to be in place that strategically allow for the utilization of this reserve to decrease emissions, to provide relief in emergencies, and to understand that we must have a 21st century Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Let me cite for you, Mr. Speaker, when this reserve has been used: 2005, Hurricane Katrina sale; 1991, Operation Desert Storm; 1990, Desert Storm--Shield tests; 2006, ship channel closure exchange; 2006, barge accident exchange; 2005, Hurricane Katrina exchange; 2000, heating oil exchange. Again, it is doing what it is supposed to do. At the same time, I believe it is important to modernize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I have a very simple amendment. My amendment would preserve exchanges that occur and protect the Nation from gasoline shortages and likely much higher fuel prices following natural disasters. We have had many, and I cannot, for the life of me, understand the opposition to what President Biden did where we have heard complete silence about high gasoline prices. So it is important in amendment No. 35 that we have the ability to help those desperately suffering from natural disasters that certainly occur in the Gulf. They also occur in the Atlantic, and they occur in the Pacific, and we need to be able to help the American people. I ask my colleagues to support Jackson Lee amendment No. 35 that would preserve exchanges that occur to protect the Nation from gasoline shortages in the likely face of the terrible natural disasters that have hit our American citizens or our country in various regions. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support amendment No. 35 to help the American people and to ensure that when disasters come, America stands with the American people. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I rise to speak in support of the Jackson Lee Amendments to H.R. 21, the Strategic Production Response Act, which will improve the bill. As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and a member representing the 18th Congressional District in Houston, Texas, I am well aware of the critical importance of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to our nation's security. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the world's largest supply of emergency crude oil, was established primarily to reduce the impact of disruptions in supplies of petroleum products and to carry out obligations of the United States under the international energy program. Following the oil shocks of the late 1970s, the nation prepared to secure its energy future by developing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. On August 4, 1980, President Jimmy Carter issued Executive Order 12231--Strategic Petroleum Reserve. In this action, he transferred the functions vested in the President by Section 7430(k) of Title 10 of the United States Code to the Secretary of Energy. The nation owes a debt of gratitude to President Carter for his foresight and willingness to pursue such a bold effort to ensure the nation's energy security. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a federally-owned oil stockpile of crude oil stored in huge underground salt caverns at four sites along the coastline of the Gulf of Mexico. Two Strategic Petroleum Reserve containment facilities are near Houston, Texas: the Bryan Mound in Brazoria County and Big Hill in Jefferson County. Over my tenure in the House of Representatives I have seen the value and necessity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. For the past 27 years, I have been Co-Chair of the Energy Braintrusts of the Congressional Black Caucus. Energy is the Live Blood of the Economy. The electricity that powers our cities, heats our homes, fuels innovation in businesses, and supports the work of local, state, and federal governments to serve the public all depend on low-cost, accessible, and available energy. Too often, we take for granted how fortunate we are to live in a nation and what a rich store of energy in the form of fossil fuels, wind, solar, and hydropower. I believe in the importance of an innovative and forward-thinking energy posture for this nation. My work includes hosting Energy Braintrusts designed to bring all relevant players ranging from environmentalists to producers of energy from various sectors, including coal, electric, natural gas, nuclear, oil, and alternative energy sources, as well as producers from Africa. The oil and gas industry provides many jobs for many of my constituents and opportunities for small businesses in the 18th Congressional District of Texas. In past Congresses, I have offered bills to promote deficit reduction and job creation that could increase leasing of the outer continental shelf oil and gas resources under the control of the federal government. Times change as does the needs of the nation--today our major threat is climate change. For these reasons, throughout my time in Congress, I have advanced my interests in a balance among the sources of home-grown energy sources comprised of fossil fuels, natural gas, wind, and solar energy. The Jackson Lee Amendments offered for consideration under H.R. 21 would create avenues for providing access to routine operational functions for maintenance of the Petroleum Reserve that is essential to operations. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you consider that the location of the reserves and the location of the refineries that produce gasoline, fuel oil, and heating oil are highly concentrated along the Upper Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast. The strategic importance is not just when gasoline prices might go up but when the nation's national interests are threatened. Instances of the reserve's oil being used include: 2011 IEA Coordinated Release 2005 Hurricane Katrina Sale 1991 Operation Desert Storm Sale 1990 Desert Shield Test Sale 2017 Hurricane Harvey Exchange 2012 Hurricane Isaac Exchange 2008 Hurricanes Gustav and Ike Exchanges 2006 Ship Channel Closure Exchange 2006 Barge Accident Exchange 2005 Hurricane Katrina Exchange 2004 Hurricane Ivan Exchange 2002 Hurricane Lili Exchange 2000 Heating Oil Exchange 2000 Ship Channel Closure Exchange 1999 Maya Exchange 1996 Pipeline Blockage Exchange If the reserve had not been tapped in each of these instances, the consequences to the American public would have been higher fuel prices. Shocks to the economy are difficult to weather by those on set incomes like retired persons or low-income families. Economic harms caused by higher fuel costs are a threat to American families and should be considered when considering the national interest in using the reserves, which are paid for by the working people of this nation. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 35 This Jackson Lee amendment would continue to allow the Secretary of Energy to permit drawdowns of crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to supply refineries should natural or manmade disasters disrupt port facilities or transportation systems that disrupt deliveries of crude to refineries for the production of gasoline, fuel oil, or heating oil. An important benefit to having the world's largest crude oil reserve occurs following a major hurricane hitting the upper Texas or Southern Louisiana Coast when ports and docking facilities may have sustained damage that prevents the off-loading of crude to refineries. Drawdowns from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in response to disasters does aid the national interest in keeping supplies of gasoline, fuel oils, and heating oil flowing to consumers. Any disruption in the production of these energy products would immediately trigger higher prices that would hit the pocketbooks of American families. The benefits of providing exchanges of oil from the preserve to refiners and having the crude delivered later to replenish what was used with additional amounts added to the reserve a few months after the drawdown is beneficial to the nation and the oil industry as a whole. This Jackson Lee Amendment would preserve exchanges that occur and protect the nation from gasoline shortages and likely much higher fuel prices following natural disasters that impact the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coasts. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 36 This Jackson Lee amendment would allow the necessary and routine test drawdowns that occur as part of the work to maintain the efficiency of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ensure that it functions as intended during an emergency use permissible by law or regulation. Tests are essential to the core mission of the preserve and often involve 5,000,000 barrels or less being drawn down. This Jackson Lee Amendment would provide that Strategic Petroleum Reserve tests would not trigger the provisions of this bill. The Jackson Lee amendment would ensure that tests can continue without delay or suspension out of concern regarding the requirements of this bill. I ask my colleagues to support both of these Jackson Lee Amendments. I understand that the bill's authors have a specific policy objective in mind and believe that the legislation will accomplish a minor policy change. I would offer that sometimes a little change can have severe consequences and that we might be far better if bipartisan efforts were pursued when it comes to a successful policy accomplishment that is the envy of the world and a vital national resource."

Having grown up on the Gulf Coast of Texas, first, Hurricane Carla, in 1961, I went through that. I think I understand the Gulf Coast of Texas, and I think I understand hurricanes. I have been there a long time. So I have to rise in opposition to this amendment. Why? This amendment fails to see that depleting our strategic reserve for nonemergency reasons could actually hurt our ability to help the American people exactly in those times and those events of a real supply interruption like a hurricane or natural disaster. Lord knows I have lived and been through a lot of them. This amendment would jeopardize Americans' energy security and energy jobs in several ways. First, it actually creates a loophole to allow ``test sales,'' Mr. Speaker, of oil out of the strategic reserve to be exempted even when it is not an emergency like we talked about on the Gulf Coast of Texas, my home area. How do we know this? History teaches us a valid lesson. For instance, under this amendment, the Biden administration could abuse its authority by using, again, a ``test sale'' to fund a new government program just like President Obama did in 2014. Second, again, it takes the lawmaking role of Congress and gives it to the executive branch. I have read the Constitution, too. I have read the Constitution. It gives the Department of Energy the power to decide whether the law takes effect. That is unbelievable to me, Mr. Speaker. Finally, even though it ``conditions'' the effective date on a finding by the Department of Energy, the DOE, in no way--in no way-- does it require the Energy Department to make a finding of one way or the other. We could be stuck in limbo for Lord knows how long. This amendment would make the bill worse, and, indeed, it is a poison pill. For this I urge my colleagues to make a ``no'' vote. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "a common refrain that I hear from Republicans is that unilateral action by the United States to reduce greenhouse gases would harm our economy and wouldn't move the needle on reducing global emissions. The core of this argument is that if we are going to address climate change, we need to coordinate an international response. Of course, this argument completely falls apart when you take a look at the actions of the House Republicans. Many cheered as the previous administration removed the United States from the Paris Agreement. Exiting the largest international agreement to combat global climate change not only weakened our diplomatic standing abroad, but it made it abundantly clear that Republicans don't care about addressing climate change. Now, thankfully, President Biden rejoined the Paris Agreement, putting that embarrassing chapter behind us, but it appears that House Republicans want to go back to burying their heads in the sand when it comes to combating climate change, as was made clear by this amendment. This amendment would repeal section 115 of the Clean Air Act, which provides EPA with a tool to address air pollution while promoting international cooperation to combat climate change. As my Republican colleagues should know by now, air pollution does not respect boundaries, whether these are State or international. Section 115 provides the EPA administrator the authority to set limits on an air pollutant that is harming public health and welfare in another country as long as the other country grants reciprocal rights to the United States. The gentleman's amendment would remove this discretionary authority, gutting our ability to cooperate with our neighbors. We have agreements with Canada and with Mexico, and we show leadership with the international community by working with our neighbors to try to deal with air pollution. Climate change is a global problem. We need to work with other nations like we worked with Canada and Mexico and provide the leadership to encourage international engagements to tackle this crisis. I have to say: I don't believe the Republican majority wants to act on climate crisis internationally or domestically. Case in point, the polluters over people act we are dealing with today. It attempts to repeal popular provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act: The greenhouse gas reduction fund, the methane emissions reduction program, and $4.5 billion in home electrification rebates. Now, House Democrats took historic action to combat the climate crisis by passing the Inflation Reduction Act, which included unparalleled investments in climate and clean energy. Not a single House Republican voted for it, but if we can't act domestically and we can't act in coordination with our neighbors, even Canada and Mexico, what are we going to do to address the threat caused by the climate crisis? According to this amendment, the answer is apparently nothing. We are not going to do anything domestically. We are not going to do anything with our neighbors. We are not going to do anything internationally. We are going to do nothing. I just think that is unacceptable. At a time of real crisis, as highlighted by the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report, we should empower EPA to combat dangerous climate change and strongly encourage other nations to do the same. We shouldn't be taking any tools off the table, and that is what this amendment does. It takes the tool off the table. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment repeals section 115 of the Clean Air Act. This vital amendment protects the autonomy of the States over their own energy sectors by ensuring that unelected, unaccountable EPA bureaucrats cannot seize control over these vital industries under the guise of emissions reductions. The Constitution clearly reserves this power to the States, and it is long overdue that we bring Federal policies back in line with the very Constitution that we swore an oath to. Section 115 gives EPA the authority to impose emission reductions on the States if the administrator finds, based on the word of some international organization--just based on their good word--that American air pollution endangers the public health and welfare of another country. Imagine if we could do that to China? The administrator determines that that country will lower their emissions a commensurate amount. Put a different way, section 115 allows the EPA to rely on the credibility of the same international elites who misled us about COVID to force our constituents to change every aspect of their lives because some European nation thought it would be great to do the same thing. Now, we would have to do the same thing. This is no longer a hypothetical. Since President Biden reentered the Paris climate agreement, it can be argued that these conditions have been met and EPA can immediately impose devastating requirements as it was argued when the Obama administration first entered the agreement. Subjecting such an important sector of our economy to the whims of foreign bureaucrats is downright reckless and hands U.S. sovereignty over to a foreign ideologue--not even foreign governments, just foreign bureaucrats. Removing the broadly written language in section 115 is the only way to prevent the delegation of nearly unlimited power over State energy sectors to the EPA bureaucrats and removes the ability of international organizations to meddle in our energy sector. It is vital that we prevent this Federal power grab before it imposes devastating economic consequences by empowering the States to meet the needs and interests of their own citizens. Language to prevent the use of section 115 of the Clean Air Act has passed the House three times under Republican majorities: Twice in the 115th Congress and once in the 114th. To those who view this amendment as premature because the administration has not yet acted under section 115, the impact was never questioned in the past. How many times do we have to wake up and say, well, I didn't think they would do it? I didn't think they would actually defund the police. I didn't think they would have the IRS show up at the guy's house when he was testifying in Congress. Heaven forbid, I didn't believe they would actually try and ban my gas stove. I thought they were just kidding around. They didn't really mean it. They do mean it. We know the administration is going to do so because the radical environmental groups that control their agenda have come out and said it. Here are a couple examples. The League of Conservation Voters: ``While there has been limited use of section 115, numerous scholars have advocated for its use as a pathway to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly since the Paris Agreement.'' How about Foreign Policy for America: This amendment would undermine EPA's authority for ``its potential future applications to greenhouse gases.'' Yeah, we want to undermine their authority and make the authority of the States preeminent. The authority of citizens should be preeminent. Preemptively removing this authority from the administration before they can act is vital to U.S. sovereignty and our economic well-being. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time."

              "there was some discussion earlier and an allegation made that Democrats have yet to introduce any policy to reduce our energy costs, as if we have completely forgotten about the sweeping, multibillion-dollar investments in the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce people's costs across the board. I am rising today to stand in opposition to H.R. 1. While Republicans try to claim that this is a bill to lower people's energy costs, what we really see when we start digging into it, is that what this bill actually shows us by the Republican authors is that they actually have no plan to reduce our utility bills or even prevent climate disaster in the United States. The central argument and logic of this bill is that if you give Big Oil everything they want, then perhaps they will lower our gas prices. It is a form of trickle-down fantasy that just will not make life easier for everyday Americans. What H.R. 1 will do is give Big Oil more leases of public lands. This idea that an increased supply of fossil fuels will drive down prices is also mistaken. Let's look at what happened last year. We saw how Big Oil more than doubled its profits to $219 billion, all while price gouging customers at the pump, not because of supply issues but because they can. Republicans opposed solutions that we put forward, like a windfall tax on price gouging on Big Oil in order to prevent these kinds of behaviors. Fossil fuel companies, moreover, already have thousands of unused permits on public lands, yet they want even more. This is not a problem of supply. It is a problem of greed and abuse of market power. I, along with many of my colleagues, called for that windfall tax. What does this bill do instead? It is almost as if you gave a pen to an oil lobbyist and wrote down everything that they want. Much of that is in this bill. We are looking at reducing Big Oil's royalty rates to the public and slashing interest fees. For people following at home, if you are a member of the American public, if you are a taxpaying citizen, you are part of the ownership of our public lands. When an oil company decides to lease that land, they are supposed to pay a royalty to the public. What does H.R. 1 do? It slashes that royalty rate so that there is very little payback or investment into the American people and many of our programs. In this bill, Republicans are squarely on the side of fossil fuel companies. It makes it harder for communities to fight Big Oil when they don't want them drilling in their own backyards. It also threatens our public lands and allows anyone to stake a mining claim on our public lands for less than $10 an acre, even if they haven't discovered any minerals. Despite the fact that more than 40 percent of Americans live in counties hit by climate disasters, this bill prohibits agencies from even considering climate change when deciding whether or not to issue a permit to a drilling company. None of these things are going to lower our costs at the pump. None of these things are going to actually reduce our utility bills. In fact, in talking about this allegation of a lack of Democrat proposals, Democrats introduced 95 amendments, proposed 95 amendments to this bill, and the Republican majority rejected all but seven. I, myself, personally sponsored an amendment in the spirit of this bill, allegedly, to try to reduce prices, and my amendment would have made sure that the subsidies that the Federal Government provides to oil and gas companies actually make their way to the American people-- instead of lining the pockets of billionaire CEOs--and actually have the intended effect. Republicans rejected that amendment, too. They have made clear where they stand. I cannot emphasize enough how detrimental and damaging this bill would be, not only to the climate crisis, not only to the purpose of even trying to reduce our utility costs, but moreover, for the ability for the American people to actually receive an investment on the public lands that they lease out.",
              "I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1. The Republicans call it the Lower Energy Costs Act. In fact, it does the opposite, and it puts polluters over people, so we call it the polluters over people act. That is justified because that is exactly what it does. This bill is nothing more than a grab bag of Big Oil giveaways and loopholes that endanger the health, safety, and security of Americans. It does absolutely nothing to lower energy costs for American families. In fact, it will actually drive up costs while doubling down on costly fossil fuels. Now, does the GOP really believe that Big Oil cares about Americans? During the COVID crisis in the last 3 years, we had a hearing where we brought in some of the large oil companies. It was quite clear that they wanted to keep prices high. It was quite clear that they were benefiting from OPEC and the fact that Russia had invaded Ukraine and that oil supplies had become more limited because of that invasion of Ukraine and that as a result, prices for oil and gasoline were going up. They didn't care. They liked it. We actually asked them at the hearing whether or not they would increase production because they have so many leases on Federal lands that they don't use, and they said no. They said maybe eventually they would do that, but they haven't gotten around to it yet. I don't think they have gotten around to it still. So this notion that somehow by benefiting Big Oil, the major American so-called oil companies, that this is going to help the American people, that is not their goal. Last year, Big Oil's profits in 2022 were $451 billion, a record high. The dividends they gave out and the stock buyouts amounted to $163 billion. They only care about the stockholders. They don't care about the price of gasoline. They want it to stay high. They don't care whether Americans can afford gasoline. Chairwoman Rodgers, who I really respect a lot, talked about LNG. One of the things in the bill is it removes the requirement--and I am going to talk about other things it does--but it removes the requirement that liquified natural gas exports be determined to be in the public interest before being sent overseas. That is going to lead to more American LNG being sent to our adversaries, including China. This helps China. This doesn't hurt China. This helps China. We know that there was a time a few years ago when LNG exports were limited because of--I forget what caused it--and during that period of time, the evidence shows the price for American gasoline or American crude was actually going down. When you send LNG overseas, it is not available here in the United States. That actually lowers gas prices when you have more gasoline available or more refineries available to process gasoline here in the United States. I debunk this idea that somehow this bill is going to lower prices here, that somehow benefiting Big Oil benefits Americans, that somehow exporting more LNG hurts China. These things simply are not the case. The evidence proves very much to the contrary. This bill, H.R. 1, I will call it the polluters over people act, rescinds several transformational climate programs that the Democrats enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act last year. What I am trying to get across today is that at the same time that they are helping Big Oil, not driving down prices, and helping China, the Republicans are also tearing down all of the environmental laws that we have had for the last 50 years and putting all the emphasis on fossil fuels rather than clean energy. The bottom line is, the only way that we are going to lower costs is by encouraging clean energy. Yes, I agree with Chairwoman Rodgers that the United States has to be a bigger energy producer, but the future for that is with clean energy, not with pumping more oil and gas. It is by encouraging clean energy because that is where we can be the big producer. That is where the future is. That is where we can outcompete the rest of the world. What does this bill do? It foolishly repeals the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which invests in high-impact projects that reduce pollution, creates good-paying clean energy jobs, and improves public health. They obviously do not want to do anything for clean energy. It also repeals the methane emissions reduction program, which protects the health of our communities and ensures that polluters, not taxpayers or customers, pay for wasted methane. Let me use that as an example. I want everyone to understand that when we passed the Inflation Reduction Act and we were trying to cut back on greenhouse gases which lead to global climate problems and the increase in global warming, we worked hard to deal with those industries here that could be affected. The Methane Emissions Reduction Act is a perfect example that we worked with the independent oil producers because they said, well, if you cause the methane that is wasted now and goes into the atmosphere and causes this increased number of greenhouse gases, if you work with us, we can accomplish capturing this methane and then it can be recycled, but we need some money to accomplish that. We provided them with a fund so they could make that transition. We also said that if it took them time to get a permit to capture the gas and provide a recycling program for the methane, that they would not be penalized by doing that. This has been characterized by the GOP as some sort of tax or fee on the industry. It is really a penalty if they don't do what is necessary to capture methane and avoid it going into the atmosphere. The same is true for almost every provision that they seek to repeal here. These are provisions that try to protect the public health, reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but at the same time don't have a negative impact on those industries that are hiring people and that create jobs. At the same time, try to move toward new clean energy things like wind, solar, and more hydropower, and other things that actually do create more jobs, as we have proven that they have. There are so many other things that repeal--I won't go through all of them because I know that we have other speakers. The bill also repeals the popular home electrification rebates that are specifically designed to lower energy bills for American families. These are popular incentives that will save families money and are urgently needed to help us fight the climate crisis. Republicans are rejecting all these things that help people save money, help reduce greenhouse gases so they can double-down on the old pro-polluter policies that they have had for years. This bill also does nothing to meaningfully address permitting reform. Its vision of permitting consists of letting polluters do whatever they want, and instead, the bill becomes a sweetheart deal. The bill, for example, doesn't include any changes to the transmission policy necessary to ensure that clean energy can reach all corners of the country. Let me also give you a couple of other examples. The biggest thing that they do to basically endanger all of our environmental protections is they exempt so-called critical energy resources from the Clean Air Act and hazardous waste permitting requirements. They say if we label a refinery or if we label a utility as a critical energy resource, then they don't have to follow the Clean Air Act, they don't have to follow the Clean Water Act, and they don't have to follow the Hazardous Waste Act. It is a roundabout way of saying that we are just going to let all these industries do whatever they want, even though it undercuts public health protections. They do the same thing with toxic chemicals. We had a major toxic chemical bill to try to cut back on toxic chemicals that needlessly expose families and children to health risks. They basically get rid of that by saying, oh, those facilities don't have to worry about releasing toxic chemicals. Mr. Speaker, I end by saying this. Democrats understand that the transition to clean energy is important. In fact, projects already underway are valued at tens of billions of dollars and have already created more than 100,000 good-paying jobs. Our Inflation Reduction Act is estimated to create 9 million new jobs over the coming decade and reduce energy costs by an average of $1,800 per year. What we have done in the last few years as Democrats is to try to move toward clean energy, understanding that you still have to have fossil fuels and nuclear and other things, but understanding that the future in terms of the U.S. being a major energy producer is in clean energy, not in fossil fuels. To just wreck and put a bulldozer through all our environmental protections in order to encourage fossil fuels is just a huge mistake. It is not going to lower energy costs. It is going to make it much more difficult for us to reduce greenhouse gases and all the negative impacts of climate change. There is nothing in here. In my opinion, this bill is also going to hurt us from a national security point of view because it does actually help China and help our adversaries rather than making it more difficult for them to compete with us. Mr. Speaker, I would urge opposition to the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we are here today to consider a rule for H.R. 1, a bill that might as well be called the polluters over people act. It is yet another example of how this majority, instead of helping everyday Americans, is doing the bidding of their deep-pocketed friends. We had another mass shooting yesterday, but Republicans won't lift a finger because of the gun lobby. We had another train derailment this week, but Republicans won't lift a finger because of the polluters. Our planet is on fire, but Republicans won't lift a finger because of Big Oil. Banks are going under, but Republicans want to deregulate more to help their friends on Wall Street. They want to protect kids from what teachers teach in the classroom but not against lead pipes in schools. They say they want to stop inflation but won't go after the billionaire corporations who aren't paying any taxes while they rip people off. Time after time after time, Republicans continue to put politics over people, and it shows. Anyone who spends 2 seconds reading this bill can see that it is a dirty energy, pro-polluter plan that would drag our economy back decades. This bill puts polluters over people. It makes it easier for companies to strip public lands of their resources and harder to hold corporate polluters accountable for the mess they make. It gives more handouts to Big Oil, as if the industry's CEOs and shareholders haven't already raked in enough money with record profits over the last few years. It guts half a century of environmental protections that ensure the air we breathe and the water we drink is clean, and it sets our country back as the rest of the world moves toward a clean energy future. There will be plenty of time for us to talk about all the damage the polluters over people act could do to our country and communities, but let me just highlight a few of the worst. First, it increases the national deficit by half a billion dollars. Considering how much we hear from our colleagues across the aisle about the deficit and the deficit and the deficit, it is fascinating that their most important bill blows a hole in the deficit. So much for their commitment to fiscal discipline. Don't take my word for it, just consult the CBO. It is a little bit ironic on a day that they are asking that there be dramatic cuts in all kinds of programs that help people in this country, they come up with this bill and add close to a half a billion dollars to our deficit. Second, it is a job killer. This bill will kill jobs. Over the last few years, Democrats have invested in building a homegrown, clean energy system so we don't have to rely on foreign cartels like OPEC and greedy Big Oil companies for our energy. Investing in these clean energy projects meant we created millions of clean energy jobs. The polluters over people act would kill these jobs and pull our country off course from our path toward a cleaner, cheaper energy future. Third, it makes it easier to pollute, and it makes it easier for companies to get away with polluting. Just yesterday, a local grandfather in East Palestine, Ohio, detailed the pain caused by the terrible toxic spill there. He said he has ``never cried this much in his life.'' His young granddaughters developed blotches all over their bodies, and their eyes were burning. This bill would mean more billionaire corporations getting away with polluting without being held accountable, more wells with toxic chemicals, more days where windows are shut because the air is not safe to breathe, more kids diagnosed with asthma because the air quality is so poor. The worst part is that the Republicans do not care. Their bill literally puts polluters over the people we are here to serve. It forces American taxpayers to foot the bill for cleanup while billionaire corporations dump their toxic waste on our communities. This is sick. Look at what is happening to our planet, Mr. Speaker. Year after year, the warmest ever recorded; species going extinct at rates not seen in millions of years; sea levels rising and coastal communities feeling the impact; farmers struggling to cope with changing seasons, unprecedented droughts, and crop failures. The answer from my Republican friends is more fossil fuels, more pollution, more drilling, more toxic waste dumped into our communities, more giveaways for Big Oil, and nothing, not a single thing, to lower energy prices. This bill might as well put ExxonMobil and Chevron in charge of our response to climate change. It might as well put Norfolk Southern in charge of chemical safety. It is a terrible bill that will shackle us to dirty fossil fuels for generations to come. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time."

We love our coastal playground. We respect our coastal communities. And that is why we must fight to protect them--not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Oregonians who cherish our environment and our people. Oregon led with the first-ever ``Bottle Bill'' to reduce litter on the beaches. Oregon led when it made its coastline free and open to the public. Now we must lead the fight against offshore drilling, which threatens our coastline, the people who call it home, and fisheries and families who depend on it for their livelihoods, and our environment. Offshore drilling is a mistake, and it will only exacerbate our energy and environmental crisis down the road. We must say ``no'' by voting ``yes'' on this amendment.",
              "my district includes 250 miles of entirely public beaches on a coastline renowned for its pristine and rugged beauty. Our fishing community relies on clean oceans. It is our responsibility to protect these waters that are vital for our coastal economies and ocean ecosystems. It is my duty to protect our oceans, the livelihood of the fishing industry on the Oregon coast, and the way of life for the next generation of coastal Oregonians. The fossil fuel industry has 2,000 leases covering 12 million acres for offshore drilling that are currently not being used. This is just bait and switch by the oil companies who are making record profits while they are price gouging Americans at the gas pump. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support Representative DelBene's amendment to protect Oregon and Washington's coast for future generations.",
              "I rise to offer an amendment prohibiting oil and gas leasing on any tract of the Washington-Oregon Planning Area, where leasing would negatively impact coastal fisheries. The health of our economies depends on a clean Pacific. Washington generates over $8.5 billion of revenue in fisheries and seafood processing a year. My district is home to one of the most fishing- dependent communities in the entire U.S. Pacific County is home to the largest shellfish-producing community on the entire West Coast. Pacific County produces almost 50 million pounds of shellfish a year. That is 600 jobs and over $10 million of value. The towns of Ilwaco and Chinook support over 200 fishing vessels. That is 1,300 jobs, generating 21 million pounds of fish and shellfish and $25 million of personal income. To be clear, this is critical to the economies of our coastal communities. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve will continue to be a critical part of our national security infrastructure, and oil and gas will continue to be part of our energy economy for a long time, but we can't sacrifice our rural economies for a one-off jackpot in oil. I am proud to offer this amendment to protect coastal fisheries and the communities they support, and I am glad to stand up for people who work for a living. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

              "I rise in support of the amendment introduced by my friend and colleague, the gentlelady from Virginia. Virginia is blessed with beautiful coastlines. The Atlantic Coast and Chesapeake Bay provide critical habitat to marine life and offer numerous recreational opportunities to locals and tourists. Virginia's coasts are also home to a growing source of clean, affordable, and domestic energy thanks to ideal windspeeds, shallow waters, shipping lanes free of overhead obstruction, and a talented workforce. Located 27 miles off the coast, the first two turbines in federal waters are not visible from shore. The benefits they generate, however, are increasingly being felt on shore as emissions are lowered and good, family-sustaining jobs are created. These exciting developments are in sharp contrast to what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have planned for our coastal communities--an expansion of offshore drilling. We ought to learn from the tragic mistakes of our past: Exxon Valdez in the Prince William Sound, Santa Barbara off the coast of Southern California, and Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico. Throughout my career, I have opposed attempts to open Virginia's coastline to offshore drilling along with local communities, small businesses, scientists, beachgoers, environmentalists, seafood lovers, and people of faith. The Virginia Beach Restaurant Association, the Virginia Beach Hotel Association, and the Virginia Restaurant, Lodging and Travel Association all oppose offshore drilling along with Oceana, the Sierra Club, Chesapeake Climate Action Network, Surfrider Foundation, Virginia Interfaith Power & Light and so many others. National security experts also warn that offshore drilling is incompatible with military training in the region, not to mention the incredible harm a spill would do to military facilities. As sea levels in Norfolk and around the world continue to rise, any expansion of highly polluting fossil fuel infrastructure is simply a bad idea. Virginians are simply not willing to sacrifice the health of our climate, marine life, local economies, or coastal ecosystems to expand offshore drilling. The growth of offshore wind in the region further underscores the false choice being presented by my Republican colleagues. Virginians are already enhancing our energy security by harnessing the power of the wind. Thanks to the investments in the Inflation Reduction Act-- including provisions I introduced with Representatives Pascrell, Norcross, Luria, and the late Congressman McEachin--the future of offshore wind and domestic offshore wind manufacturing is bright. Virginians have repeatedly stood together to protect our coasts and, as this amendment demonstrates, we will continue to do so. I urge my colleagues to protect Virginia's coasts by supporting this amendment.",
              "H.R. 21 unnecessarily opens large swaths of public lands and waters to oil and gas drilling, including the coast of Florida. This would really jeopardize Florida's fragile offshore waters, our beautiful beaches. Clean water, clean air, clean beaches are central to our way of life, and are the cornerstone of our economy. For many years, the State of Florida has enjoyed a moratorium on drilling because leaders at the national level recognized that Florida beaches and our offshore waters were a national resource. That moratorium expired last year, unfortunately. So now with H.R. 21, Florida is at risk again. My amendment would reinstitute that moratorium. In fact, it would permanently ban drilling off of the coast of Florida. This has enjoyed bipartisan support here in the Congress and back home. How do Floridians feel about drilling off of our beaches? Well, we passed a constitutional amendment in 2018 that passed by almost 70 percent of the vote in the State of Florida. Democrats, Republicans, Independents, everyone values our way of life. Why? Because we are also keenly aware of how dirty it is, how risky it is. The impacts of oil drilling off our coast really came home to roost in 2010 after the BP Deepwater Horizon oil blowout severely affected the Gulf Coast marine ecosystems. Do you all remember that disaster, watching it day after day, month after month, after oil spewed into the Gulf of Mexico? At that time we were pretty fortunate on the West Coast of Florida, we didn't have oil that washed up on the beaches, but we were just coming out of the Great Recession. It was a hammer down on small business owners at that time. People were not coming to the Sunshine State. It caused enormous environmental impacts. I remember so well, holding in my arms and looking into the eyes of these small, mom and pop owners of motels and hotels and beach businesses, they were just devastated. We cannot put our economic and environment at risk again. It was a wake-up call. The eastern Gulf of Mexico also is an important military testing range. The Department of Defense has said they oppose oil drilling off the coast of Florida along the west coast because they do so many military training exercises. There are so many reasons that we need to act to protect our way of life, our environment, and our economy. It is what we sing about when we sing about protecting the Gulf Stream waters. This land is your land, this land is my land. They are not to be pillaged by the greed of the Big Oil companies. We are poised to make important progress on the health of our oceans and our economy. We are about to unleash the clean energy economy to create jobs, to lower costs for families, to build safer, healthier, and more resilient communities. We do not need to put our economy and our way of life at risk. So for all those reasons, I hope that all of the colleagues can join together to support the Castor amendment and permanently ban oil drilling off of the beautiful coastline of the State of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "as a proud Virginian, I rise today in defense of our region's coastal communities, our Nation's military and defense equities, the Chesapeake Bay, and the economy of the Commonwealth of Virginia. I am concerned that the legislation under consideration today would open the door to drilling of oil and gas off the shores of Virginia, something that has never been done before and something staunchly opposed by Virginians. Offshore oil and gas drilling poses a grave threat to our economy, our natural resources, and America's military infrastructure along Virginia's coast. Virginia's economy relies heavily on deepwater port commerce, and offshore drilling operations would severely impact these industries. According to one report, offshore drilling could jeopardize approximately 86,000 Virginia jobs, as well as roughly $4.8 billion in Virginia's GDP from coastal tourism, commercial fishing, and aquaculture alone. According to NOAA, in 2016, Virginia's commercial seafood industry collected more than 440 million pounds of seafood with a value of close to $300 million. This driver of Virginia's economy could be threatened under the overarching legislation considered here today. I also point out that Virginia's Wallops Island could come under threat. Wallops Island is home to space infrastructure that enables NASA missions, but offshore drilling could undermine decades of Federal, State, and local economic development efforts related to our space program. Virginia's spaceport has bolstered the local economy to the tune of $820 million annually, and it has provided thousands of jobs in our Commonwealth. Back in 2015, NASA raised the alarm bells about offshore drilling, releasing a statement that read, ``The presence of either temporary or fixed structures at or below the sea surface . . . would have significant detrimental effects on our ability to conduct aerospace test activities.'' Offshore drilling in Virginia has been shown to be a critical national security risk. According to a study published by the United States Department of Defense, any oil and gas leases off the coast of Virginia would disrupt military operations, training, and testing activities considered to be vital to our United States' national security and readiness. Finally, I am deeply concerned about the environmental impacts that offshore drilling could have in Virginia. As the largest estuary in the United States, the Chesapeake Bay has been recognized by Congress as a ``national treasure'' and has been under federally funded cleanup efforts since 1965. The Chesapeake Bay is home to more than 3,600 species of plant, fish, and animals--several dozen recognized as threatened or endangered. Over the last several decades, we have made tremendous progress in the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay. Virginians do not want to risk a disaster like the Deepwater Horizon spill. What is more, I am concerned about more regular releases of crude oil that occur in offshore operations. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation reports that spills from platforms, pipelines, and other offshore infrastructure release, on average, 157,000 barrels of oil annually. These releases would destroy many of the environmental gains that have helped revitalize Virginia's economy, Virginia's coastal communities, and the health of the Chesapeake Bay. I urge my colleagues, from those in Virginia to those across the country, to vote to protect Virginia's fishermen, farmers, coastal towns, beaches, natural beauty, and importantly, our national security by voting ``yes'' on this amendment. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

              "Democrats believe in putting people over politics. Last Congress, Democrats tackled climate change and brought down energy costs for the American people. Those investments in the Inflation Reduction Act have already spurred investments in clean energy projects and created good-paying jobs. At a time when we see rising costs, the Inflation Reduction Act will save the average American family $1,800 a year. The Biden administration is also moving forward with an important rule to limit methane emissions nationwide. New Mexico led the way on this. We strengthened our methane emissions rules in 2021. The Energy Information Administration data shows that even though we strengthened our methane emissions, we grew year after year for 5 years in natural gas and energy production. The Land of Enchantment shows us that we don't have to sacrifice the environment for energy production. H.R. 1 would sacrifice the environment and put polluters over people. Members of the majority are pursuing this at a time when CEOs for large corporations have made record profits. While the industry made $451 billion in profits just last year, New Mexicans and people throughout rural America were taking groceries out of their carts to pay for gas. H.R. 1 will not make it cheaper for the ranchers I know in Colfax County to fill up their trucks. Republicans dispute this and say the bill will lower costs. Let's see. I offered an amendment to see if that is true. My amendment simply states that H.R. 1 does not take effect until the Secretaries of Energy and of the Interior certify that it will lower costs for American taxpayers and consumers. What did the Republicans do with this commonsense amendment? They voted it down unanimously. What are they afraid of seeing? What are they afraid of debating? The reality is H.R. 1 guts our longstanding environmental safeguards. It makes it easier to dump toxic and hazardous wastes. It threatens clean drinking water and lines the pockets of the wealthiest CEOs. The Clean Water Act has long been key to protecting America's water. As we say, ``agua es vida'', ``water is life.'' This bill guts our Clean Water Act in favor of polluters. The Republicans also rejected my amendment to protect our water from mining for our farmers, ranchers, and Tribes. We have to remember that the mining that is proposed that would decimate our waters is often proposed by Chinese-owned subsidiaries or foreign-owned subsidiaries. The Republicans also blocked an amendment that would have required that Chinese subsidiaries not own our minerals.",
              "last night, the Rules Committee met and reported out a rule, House Resolution 260, providing for consideration of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1 under a structured rule. It provides 7 hours of general debate, with 3 hours equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce or their designees. Additionally, the rule provides for 3 hours equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural Resources or their designees, and 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure or their designees. Further, this rule makes in order 37 amendments and provides 1 motion to recommit. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and in support of the underlying legislation. H.R. 1 unleashes American energy, and it immediately will lower costs for families by resuming lease sales on Federal lands and waters. It will repeal fee increases on energy production, and it will end the moratorium on coal leasing. Additionally, H.R. 1 strengthens America's critical mineral supply, prohibits a moratorium on hydraulic fracking, and streamlines the permitting process. Let's remember, on day number one of his Presidency, President Biden launched a war on American energy. He canceled the Keystone XL pipeline, also, by the way, killing tens of thousands of union jobs, and he paused new and oil gas leases on Federal lands. That was day number one. Under President Trump, we had independence with U.S. energy, but, now, President Biden has drained our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to the lowest level since 1983. That is the lowest level since I have been alive. Meanwhile, the administration is increasing regulations on domestic energy production by easing regulations and incentivizing energy production in foreign, communist, and authoritarian states like Venezuela. In the words of President Biden, climate change is the existential threat to humanity. Apparently, that only applies when the U.S. is the one producing the oil and gas, not when nations like Venezuela produce the natural gas. President Trump, by contrast, opened 100 million acres of public land and water to exploration. But Biden has leased fewer acres of Federal land for oil and gas drilling than any President since the end of World War II. The results have directly impacted all Americans. On the day Joe Biden took office, the average price for a gallon of gasoline was $2.39. Today, the national average is $3.47. That is a 44 percent increase. And let's not forget June's highest rate of $5 a gallon. Due to inflation, the average American family is now paying $10,000 more in household costs under President Biden. By leaving our resources in the ground and turning to places like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela for help, Democrats are choosing to increase energy costs and risk the national security of American families. Why? All to appease far-left, radical activists, since they, the Democrats, lack the moral clarity to do what is right for our citizens. However, instead of focusing on lower energy costs, this administration thinks the most pressing energy issue is--wait for it-- banning our gas stoves. That is their priority. Don't take my word for it. While the administration is now gaslighting the American people, saying they don't stand for this, in places like New York, they have already taken the lead by announcing just yesterday they will ban gas stoves in new buildings. Americans shouldn't have to choose between driving to work, paying their electric bills, or putting food on the table. We have to lower energy costs for Americans. We have to do it now. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "this shouldn't be a controversial topic and, my hope is that folks on both sides of the aisle will be able to support this commonsense amendment. House Democrats should support this amendment because it provides the White House increased flexibility to tap more oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when necessary. House Republicans should support this amendment because this modest 5 percent increase in flexibility for the SPR also allows a modest 5 percent increase to responsibly produce American energy on Federal lands through the plan required by this bill. Having said that, this amendment doesn't mandate increased energy production. It just slightly modifies the cap. If the White House still only wants to utilize 10 percent from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and only wants the increase in Federal energy production on Federal lands to be 10 percent, this amendment still allows that flexibility. It is far past time we stopped begging foreign dictators to produce oil and gas for America. America makes the cleanest energy in the world. In fact, our natural gas is 42 percent cleaner than Russian natural gas. American innovation has allowed America to be the global leader in reducing emissions since the year 2000. We should be producing the energy Americans need right here in the good old U.S. of A. Yet, on President Biden's watch, we have seen a 40 percent increase in gas prices. In order to help combat their significantly flawed energy strategy, the White House raided the Strategic Petroleum Reserves by more than 40 percent. My amendment prevents this type of abuse while slightly increasing the amount of oil that can be drawn from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve during an actual emergency like President Trump did. The root causes of this record-breaking inflation were trillions of dollars of wasteful spending federally and unnecessary attacks on American energy. The Biden administration waged an all-out war on American energy production. Biden shut down the Keystone XL pipeline on day one of his administration, imposed new rules to block pipeline projects, canceled oil and gas leases on millions of acres in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico, suspended oil drilling leases in a small sliver of ANWR, even though Congress passed a law for this very purpose. He imposed a moratorium on new Federal oil and gas leases on Federal lands, failed to meet the statutory deadlines for quarterly lease sales, and took countless other anti-energy measures that have contributed to increased gas prices and inflation reaching record levels. The only reason oil and gas permits on Federal lands are being approved at nearly the same rate during the Biden administration as during the Trump administration is because of the permitting reforms put in place by the Trump administration. In essence, they had a head start. This administration also likes to try and take credit for supporting oil and gas production, but the reality is this occurred in spite of them, not because of them. In fact, much of this production has occurred on private lands where producers aren't stifled by Federal policies and moratoriums. In 2020, the National Ocean Industries Association found that Joe Biden's proposal to ban new offshore oil and gas drilling in Federal waters would kill approximately 200,000 jobs, cost the Federal Government billions of dollars of revenue, and push production to foreign adversaries. Furthermore, and despite the exaggerations from the administration, domestic production reached its highest point ever in 2020 while President Donald J. Trump was in office with over 13 million barrels of oil produced a day. We all want clean air. We all want clean water. But we also want lower gas prices and good-paying jobs right here in America. We can have it all, as responsible energy production and conservation are not mutually exclusive goals. My amendment strikes the right balance. Again, it allows for responsible emergency use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves while also allowing for responsible American energy production on Federal lands. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson)."

              "I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1, which should be called the polluters over people act. This is a critical moment. Just last week, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its sixth and final assessment, which presents our most comprehensive understanding of climate science to date. It is not, as my colleague suggested, that you can go outside and breathe fresh air and decide that there is no climate change. Scientists have made it abundantly clear, there are two options: significantly cut emissions now or face catastrophic challenges ahead. Future generations will look back and scrutinize the decisions we make as leaders. Did we have the political courage to take action or did we ignore science, stifle the most vulnerable voices in our community, and leave a climate catastrophe for our children and grandchildren? In northwest Oregon, my home, smoke from raging wildfires made the air unhealthy to breathe, and in the summer of 2021 hundreds of people in the Pacific Northwest died from a 1 in 10,000 year heat dome event where temperatures reached 118 degrees. Acidic oceans are harming our fishing industries. That is from carbon pollution. Droughts and extreme weather patterns jeopardize the livelihoods of our farmers. Warmer temperatures in the Columbia River are further endangering salmon that are so vital to the region and indigenous peoples. H.R. 1 is a dangerous move in the wrong direction under the guise of promoting lower energy costs. It would do no such thing, and the American people will not be fooled. Instead, this bill is a package of anti-climate and anti-public lands policy that would undermine recent environmental protections, destroy the National Environmental Policy Act, and take a significant step back in the fight against climate change. The bill will also raise, not lower, costs for working families by repealing tax cuts the Democrats passed last year for home efficiency upgrades. It even repeals the methane emissions reduction program. While Americans faced higher gas prices, make no mistake, the top five big oil companies made record profits--more than $196 billion last year--that is more than the economic output of most countries. These companies abuse billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded subsidies, stockpiled thousands of unused leases on millions of acres of public lands and engage in price gouging at the pump. This bill? It advances policies that allow Big Oil to increase their profits, even more at the expense of our constituents. The bill would expedite dirty mining operations, exempt oil, gas, and drilling industries from adhering to important environmental regulations, shorten public review timelines, and limit public engagement. We must protect our bedrock environmental laws that safeguard communities and allow the public to have a say in local projects. We must continue the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, which finally, after so many years, will make significant investments we need to save our planet. Addressing the climate crisis cannot be delayed. We must defeat this bill and turn our attention to investments that create jobs.",
              "Mr. Speaker, today I rise in urgent opposition to the Republicans' H.R. 1. Last week, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its final report. Their message couldn't be clearer. We have a lot to do and very little time to do it before the ticking climate bomb we are living in goes off. I want to emphasize that their message wasn't one of complete despair. There is hope. The hope hinges on two major conditions. One, we must stop burning fossil fuels, the number one cause of climate change. And two, we must transform our energy system to a cleaner and more sustainable one now. H.R. 1, the bill before us today, which has earned the fitting title of polluters over people act, will actively and aggressively take us backwards on both those accounts. Looking more like a nearly 200-page love letter to polluting industries than a serious legislative effort, the polluters over people act is a laundry list of gifts and giveaways to polluting industries. Let's look at what it does for Big Oil. For example, last year companies shattered profit records across the board by price gouging working Americans at the pump while also hoarding thousands of unused leases on our public lands and waters. Rather than hold Big Oil accountable for this abuse, the polluters over people act lowers royalty rates, repeals interest fees, reinstates noncompetitive leasing, and forces Federal agencies to hold rock-bottom lease sales all but assuring that last year's profit records will soon be broken again. Never to be outdone, the mining industry gets its fair share of gifts in H.R. 1, as well. Mining companies, many of which are foreign-owned, already enjoy a free-for-all on our public lands. They make a mockery of Tribal consultation, destroy sacred and special places, ruin the landscape, and leave behind a toxic mess that pollutes our water and hurts our health--all without paying a cent to the American people--not one red cent is paid in royalties. Now included in this package is that they can use the public land for anything they want, including dumping of toxic mineral waste. There is more, but suffice it to say, with all these handouts, it comes as no surprise that the Congressional Budget Office just reported last week that H.R. 1 will actually increase the Federal deficit. Staying true to its name, the polluters over people act also fast- tracks dirty energy projects by gutting our bedrock environmental and public health laws; namely, the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. This is not in a new so-called permitting reform solution they have come up with to address our energy needs. This is the same ideological attack I have seen Republicans in the Natural Resources Committee launch on NEPA year after year after year. For anyone who is being lured into thinking there are opportunities for negotiations on this bill--do not be naive. This performative permitting reform is not a bipartisan solution, not even a starting point for one. This is just another decades-old request from polluters to make their operations cheaper and easier, while making Americans' lives harder and more costly. It is not a serious solution to any of our energy goals. Even former President George W. Bush's head of permitting efforts has said that this bill will be ``of no statistically significant consequence.'' In fact, the polluters over people act has none of the real permitting solutions that can speed up the build-out of the clean energy infrastructure that we all need. One of those solutions would be increasing funding for Federal permitting offices, which is exactly what Democrats did when they secured more than $1 billion in last year's historic Inflation Reduction Act. Even Republicans' own witness at a hearing called that money ``wonderful.'' No more funding is in H.R. 1. Another solution for speeding up clean energy development is reforming the planning and cost allocation process for electrical transmission lines that can carry renewable energy from different sources across the country. But, no, you are not going to see that in H.R. 1 either. Of course, any real permitting reform solutions would make sure to protect and empower the communities that have been disproportionately hurt by dirty energy and other polluters for decades--and that are now being hit the hardest by climate change as well. As you can probably guess, H.R. 1 doesn't just fail to protect these communities, it silences them further, laying them bare to even more devastation, harm, and exploitation. The polluters over people act isn't just an embarrassment of riches for polluting industries, it is an embarrassment to our communities, to our climate goals, and to this legislative body. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I rise in strong opposition to House Republicans' polluters over people act, H.R. 1. This dangerous bill appears to be doubling down on dirty fossil fuels to pad the profits of polluters and Big Oil. Our Republican friends seem to be oblivious to the fact that, as we speak, there are communities in this country devastated by extreme weather events, from deadly tornadoes to life-threatening atmospheric rivers to unprecedented snowfall. Instead of legislating with an eye toward the future, our colleagues across the aisle are bringing up a bill that pretends there is no climate crisis. Scientists agree that action on climate is literally life or death. The recent IPCC report that just came out reminds us that we are out of time. It is now or never if we want to spare our kids from a future that includes more frequent and even worse extreme weather events and more climate-driven food insecurity. The world's best climate scientists call this a climate time bomb. Our Republican colleagues call it a hoax, and they produce bills like this. My colleagues seem to want to talk about speeding up permitting. Great, let's talk about permitting. Democrats just secured $1 billion for permitting streamlining in the Inflation Reduction Act for that very purpose. Let me remind you, not a single Republican voted for that bill, which was actually a solution to accelerating clean energy. What are they trying to do instead? They are trying to claw back the funding that we approved. They are trying to slow down permitting and do the exact opposite of what they claim that they want to see with their so-called permitting reform package. If they want to protect this planet for future generations, then anyone who cares about that really needs to read the fine print of this bill because it would force agencies to hold oil and gas lease sales on public lands even if they are not needed. If these sales don't get enough bids, they are replaced with more sales, at lower prices. So we are not just giving away our public lands, we are doing it at laughably low prices, locking in these lands for oil and gas development for decades to come. This is not just extreme. It is obscene. The Inflation Reduction Act included multiple oil and gas leasing reforms, modest reforms, to ensure that the public finally gets a fair share for onshore and offshore fossil fuel development. If we are going to begin to address the impacts of the climate crisis, then ending massive fossil fuel subsidies is a pretty good place to start. Under this legislation, not only are we going in the opposite direction, we are removing even these modest provisions to allow taxpayers to finally get their fair share from the incredible profits that these polluting industries would receive. This legislation lowers royalty rates, repeals interest fees, reinstates noncompetitive leasing, and it does all of this while fossil fuel companies are rolling in record profits of $451 billion for the oil and gas industry last year. H.R. 1 is the biggest rollback of the Clean Water Act that we have seen in 50 years. It will remove important clean water protections for States and Tribal Governments specifically. Under current law, section 401 of the Clean Water Act gives States and Tribes authority to review water quality as well as requirements of State law on any project or activity that requires a Clean Water Act permit. This bill would slash that authority and shorten the time frame for which they can review such projects. Make no mistake, this will make it harder to protect the waterways and the communities that depend on clean water in this country. Whether you are in East Palestine or Philadelphia or anywhere else in this country, we should know better than to take something as critical as clean water for granted. I had an amendment that would retain these section 401 protections for Tribal Governments. This was a simple test because often some of my Republican colleagues say that they believe in Tribal sovereignty and they want to empower Tribal voices. So we came up with an amendment to let them do that, to just at least take away this terrible provision when it came to Tribal Governments. They declined to move that amendment forward. It was blocked. Why do our Republican colleagues want to block Tribal voices? One of the last details that we should note, if you listen to the debt ceiling debate, this cyclical, situational concern for fiscal conservatism which is coming around again, my colleagues on the other side shout from the rooftops now about the deficit. Well, guess what? This legislation is not just bad for people, not just bad for the planet, it is fiscally irresponsible. The CBO projects that it will add to the deficit. Just a reminder, the Inflation Reduction Act, which all of my friends voted against, paid for itself and reduced the deficit. Look, we do need to be talking about permit streamlining for clean energy infrastructure. This is very important. We need more efficient procedures to bring more renewable energy online, to modernize and upgrade electricity transmission facilities, but this bill doesn't even begin to touch any of that. That is our greatest need, and it is nowhere in this bill. If my Republican friends want to be taken seriously regarding permitting reform and not just giveaways to polluters, they need to offer real solutions. This package is not it. For the sake of the planet and future generations, I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. There are real, workable solutions to addressing our energy needs, extreme weather, food insecurity, and all of the downstream consequences of climate change, but this bill doesn't do it."

              "Federal bureaucrats at the Department of Energy are threatening access to gas stoves for millions of Americans through the rulemaking process. In fact, the DOE admits that up to 50 percent of all gas stoves currently on the market or in use in American households will not meet the proposed standards. This amendment would stop the DOE from imposing this regulation. According to the DOE's own analysis, in 2020, 38 percent of Americans used natural gas to cook in their homes. The Energy Information Administration says cooking with gas is three times cheaper than cooking with electricity. The American people see this for what it is; a direct attack on all natural gas use in the country and another example of the Biden administration's desire to control every decision we make. Moreover, this rule is essentially a tax on consumers who are already being squeezed by inflation. My Democratic colleagues would argue that these rules were crafted for the purpose of saving consumers money. The DOE estimates the regulation would reduce energy use by 3.4 percent, resulting in a savings of only $21.89 over a gas range's life span. That is $1.45 per year over an average life span of 15 years for a gas range. These miniscule savings indicate this regulation is really not about the consumers' pocketbooks; it is about Federal control at the behest of radical green energy groups who want the complete elimination of the use of natural gas. I will point out were this to happen, there would be far less food to cook because natural gas is essential to fertilizer for food crops. Its elimination would cut food production in half worldwide. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "Mr. Speaker, my colleagues keep saying we are not banning gas stoves, but what would they call it when the Department of Energy's own analysis says that of the gas stoves that they have tested, only 4 percent of the market share would qualify for their new proposed rule? That means about 96 percent won't. Then they revised it to say, well, almost 50 percent will qualify. Well, that means more than 50 percent won't. I call that a ban. We are mixing words here. The other things that my Democratic colleagues keep asking is: Why wouldn't we want to save money? It is only 12 cents a month. Who is going to give up the choice of what type of stove they want for 12 cents a month? Nobody. That is not a good exchange. I would also say that if the Biden administration is not doing anything, why do all of these people support my bill? The National Association of Homebuilders, the American Restaurant Association, the American Gas Association, the American Home Appliance Manufacturers, numerous other energy companies. Mr. Speaker, I would read a little bit from the National Restaurant Association, because it talks about why this bill is important. We didn't bring it. The Republicans didn't bring this on; it was the Biden administration. With all these crises going on in our country, he has to pick on gas stoves. I don't understand why. This is what the National Restaurant Association says: Natural gas is a critical energy source for many sectors of the economy but none more than the restaurant industry. In fact, natural gas is the preferred cooking energy source for 76 percent of restaurants. Cooking with an open flame from natural gas is critical for a variety of dishes to ensure a responsive, consistent, and precise heat source that affects the quality of food served. Natural gas also allows restaurants to use certain cooking techniques that cannot be replicated with an electric stove. Finally, banning or overly restricting natural gas use could burden restaurant owners with higher operating costs, particularly local and independent restaurants. The cost to convert existing infrastructure to handle the power capacity needed to operate a commercial kitchen alone would be prohibitive for many locally owned restaurants. I say the same is true for individual homeowners. They don't want to change. They like the features on their gas stove. They don't want to give them up. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support my bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, the Save Our Gas Stoves Act. I never would have thought that I would need to introduce legislation to protect Americans' kitchen appliances, but this only goes to show how out of touch this administration's policies have become. In February, the Department of Energy proposed an extreme regulation that would effectively eliminate nearly all gas stoves and gas cooktops on the market today. The Department's proposed rule sets requirements for gas stoves at the maximum technologically feasible, or max-tech level. Based on the Department of Energy's own analysis and DOE's own technology support report, 96 percent of the market share of gas stoves will not, I repeat, not meet DOE's new proposed rule. That is a 96 percent ban. Worse yet, no gas ranges passed DOE's new proposed rule tests. Gas ranges represent nearly 90 percent of all gas stoves sold. What did DOE do after the public heard about this and pushed back? They adjusted their analysis, seemingly out of thin air. Now, they claim that nearly 50 percent of gas stoves will pass their rule. Guess what? That means more than 50 percent won't. Don't tell me they are not trying to ban gas stoves. The DOE is justifying this proposed requirement under the false guise of saving Americans money. However, the estimated savings is just $21.89 over the next 14\\1/2\\ years. That is only $1.50 per year or 12 cents per month. Consumers don't want to give up the features of the stoves they like for 12 cents per month. Consumers don't want to wait an extra 7 minutes to watch a pot of water boil for 12 cents per month. Instead of DOE bragging about how they are going to save consumers 12 cents per month, maybe they should tell the public that natural gas is 3\\1/2\\ times cheaper than electricity and that, according to studies, households that use natural gas for heating, cooking, and drying clothes save an average of $1,068 per year. Consumers don't want the government taking away the features on gas stoves that they like and use. That is not the role of the U.S. Government. That is why I introduced the Save Our Gas Stoves Act to protect Americans' consumer choice. My legislation prohibits the Department of Energy from implementing this extreme rule and prohibits the Department of Energy from imposing standards that result in the unavailability of a product based on the type of fuel the product consumes. Mr. Speaker, I thank the American Association of Homebuilders; the American Restaurant Association; the American Gas Association; the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers; the Arizona Restaurant Association; the American Public Gas Association; the National Propane Gas Association; and several energy companies, including Southwest Gas, which delivers natural gas to consumers in Arizona, for their support of my bill and for their support for American consumer choice. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that this is a bipartisan bill that has received bipartisan support and that my Republican colleagues and 29 of my Democratic colleagues already voted in favor of an amendment to H.R. 1 that did virtually the same thing as this bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my bill. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of consumer choice. I urge my colleagues to vote to save our gas stoves. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "my colleagues are saying that this bill doesn't put polluters over people. This letter I include states: ``H.R. 1 would encourage new fossil fuel production and infrastructure, locking us into increased extraction, high and volatile energy prices, and even greater profits for fossil fuel companies. It would undermine bedrock environmental laws through a short-circuiting of government accountability, meaningful public input, and review. It would put the interests of industry ahead of the public.'' Mr. Speaker, let me just say, H.R. 1 puts polluters over people. It does nothing to lower energy costs. Their bill makes it easier for companies to contaminate our water and spew pollution and God knows what else into the air. It will make us pay for corporations' messes while they leave behind a toxic trail of disaster. The polluters over people act is a massive giveaway that ensures the GOP's industry friends make more money. I would say to those who are watching this, follow the money. Look at who the oil companies are giving their money to. It jeopardizes American jobs. It worsens the climate crisis, and it takes monumental steps back from achieving a clean energy future. Mr. Speaker, we can do so much better. This is such a blatant giveaway to polluters. This is such a blatant giveaway to big corporate interests. This is such a blatant giveaway to Big Oil. It is offensive. I urge a strong ``no'' vote on this rule. I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I thank the gentleman for yielding. I do want to rise in support of the rule and in support of the underlying bill. It is interesting that our Secretary of Energy, Secretary Granholm, came to Austin, Texas, 3 or 4 weeks ago and talked about how we should learn from the communist Chinese and their approach to climate change. Talk about putting polluters over people. If she would consult her own energy information agency, she would see that China gets 55 percent of its energy from coal, whereas the United States gets 11 percent of its energy from coal. Guess what? China is building more and more coal-fired plants each and every week that goes by. So who, indeed, is putting polluters over people? I submit it is this administration, and in the last Congress it was congressional Democrats. This bill before us today is a culmination of years of hard work by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Committee on Natural Resources, and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It is a critical step forward. One of the things that I have worked on for a number of years is the Promoting Interagency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act. It is included in this bill. I think it is critically important, not just for a State like Texas but, literally, the entire country. I am grateful that other Republicans Members saw fit to include this legislation as we seek to address the obstacles preventing Americans from actually achieving lower energy costs. In less than 2\\1/2\\ years, we have gone from relative energy abundance to energy scarcity. We have gone from energy affordability to energy unaffordability. Why in the world would we want to continue down that pathway? H.R. 1 also contains the repeal of section 50131 of the Inflation Reduction Act. This provided a billion dollars to coerce State and local governments into adopting costly energy codes. If these grants were allowed to stand, they would take away local control over energy code adoption and Federalize these overreaching mandates. Efforts to push costly and restrictive energy codes across the country overburden new construction and largely ignore the energy performance of the existing housing stock. New homes built to modern codes are already energy efficient, and further increases in that stringency must be carefully considered because, in fact, we are not doing that with these grant programs. Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago the Congress started with what was called the American Rescue Plan. It brought us high inflation and it brought us high prices. This is truly the American Rescue Plan. Let's put energy affordability back within the reach of the average American.",
              "I rise today in opposition to this legislation. First, I thank the ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee for yielding. Climate change is an existential threat to the United States and the world. Without action to reduce emissions, the damage to our Nation, economy, and future generations will be immeasurable. Americans understand the severity of this moment. That is why polling shows that most Americans want to prioritize the development of alternative energy sources over expanding the production of fossil fuels. The bill before us today will do the exact opposite. H.R. 1, the polluters over people act, is a brazen giveaway to the oil, gas, and mining industries. As Big Oil reaps record profits thanks to billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies, this bill will rubberstamp the construction of new natural gas pipelines and shut government agencies out of the review process. H.R. 1 will also mandate the auctioning of our public lands for oil and gas leases, make it easier to export liquefied natural gas to foreign adversaries, and allow oil companies to price gouge working families. This bill effectively gives energy companies a license to pollute. Simply put, it is a disaster for our environment and our fight against climate change. Americans do not want energy policy to come at the expense of public health. Many of my constituents have suffered for years from air pollution emitted from a local plant that runs on burning natural gas and fuel oil. This pollution has resulted in generations of families developing asthma in what is colloquially known as asthma alley. H.R. 1 will encourage this dangerous pollution in communities across the country. That is why I have submitted two amendments. One will protect these at-risk localities by removing restrictions preventing individuals from suing in response to a violation of NEPA if they bring a claim related to protecting public health. My second amendment would require publicly traded companies to disclose their goals and actions related to greenhouse gas emissions and meeting the goals of the Paris climate accord. These amendments were rejected by the Rules Committee, as were over 90 percent of the amendments proposed by my Democratic colleagues. So much for the open amendment process Republicans promised when they took over the majority. H.R. 1 is a reckless bill that empowers polluters to boost profits for Republicans' industry friends. Last year, Democrats acted to lower energy costs for working families and weaken our dependence on fossil fuels by passing the Inflation Reduction Act. The IRA was the largest-ever investment in fighting climate change while creating thousands of good-paying jobs, attracting billions of dollars in investment, and lowering the average American family's energy costs by about $1,800 a year. H.R. 1 seeks to reverse the progress we have made since passing the IRA. Mr. Speaker, this bill will take us backward both economically and environmentally, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it."

              "as Congress considers reforms to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, I rise once again to urge my colleagues to close a dangerous loophole that has existed since 2015, which allows our foreign adversaries to purchase our strategic oil supply. As the law is currently written, oil from the SPR is sold by the Department of Energy to our highest bidders with little exceptions on what countries can purchase the U.S. supply. That means that our fiercest adversaries like China and also Russia, Iran, and North Korea and other sanctioned governments can purchase and export our strategic oil. In fact, Chinese-owned and affiliated companies have won purchase contracts during the past Presidential administrations. Simply put, this loophole is threatening to our national security. It poses threats to our American families. The American people need to act quickly. That is why, 2 weeks ago, I reached across the aisle to reintroduce a bill that my colleague, Representative Don Bacon, and I have that addresses this issue. It is called the Banning Oil Exports to Foreign Adversaries Act. This bill is straightforward, and it is common sense. It prohibits the export or sale of the SPR to China, North Korea, Russia, Iran, and any country currently under U.S. sanctions. Last week, my colleagues and I voted to pass a bill through the House that would prohibit the sale of our reserve to China, but that legislation does not go far enough. Do we want North Korea buying oil? How about Iran or Russia? It is clear that this bill remains the most comprehensive and bipartisan policy that has been put forward, and it now has more than 60 bipartisan cosponsors. As a veteran and one of the most bipartisan Members of this body, my position remains clear: We need to put our national security over party politics. We have to ensure that our foreign adversaries are not allowed to profit at the expense of America and our safety and security. I thank Mr. Gottheimer for his support for this legislation as an original cosponsor. This amendment we are speaking of right now reflects the fact that Congress has so much more work to do to close this loophole. I urge our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, to support the bipartisan Banning Oil Exports to Foreign Adversaries Act. Let's send this legislation through in proper order, strengthen it, and work together to get it signed into law. Once again, I thank Mr. Gottheimer for his commitment to this cause.",
              "before I discuss the details of my amendment, I want to applaud the new Republican majority for giving Members the opportunity to offer amendments in a more open process. The people's House has been broken for far too long, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in an open process for the remainder of this Congress. I also want to thank Chairwoman McMorris-Rodgers for her leadership on this issue to put American energy first. I cosponsored this legislation because I believe it puts America back on track to regain energy independence. This is such an important issue and critical piece of legislation that I believe we cannot stop short. We need to chart a path back to energy independence and ensure President Biden is not able to sell our critical oil supplies to China or any other rogue nation. President Biden used emergency authorities to sell hundreds of millions of barrels of oil to our enemies. My amendment would prevent President Biden from claiming an emergency to further reduce our strategic oil supplies. This is why I filed impeachment articles last Congress against President Biden on the grounds that he endangered, compromised, and undermined the energy security of the United States by selling oil from the United States' Strategic Petroleum Reserve to foreign nations. President Biden has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to the national security of our country. No President in the history of the United States has ordered a liquidation of the SPR on this scale. He sold 40 percent of our critical oil supply to trick and deceive the American people before the election. Rather than unleashing American energy here at home, he has robbed our country. When President Biden took office in 2021, the SPR contained 638 million barrels of oil. Since then, he has slashed our oil inventory to 371 million barrels. He has decimated the SPR to the lowest level since December, 1983, before some Members of this body were even born. He shredded the offers from oil companies to resupply the reserve. He gave away 7 million barrels of our oil to a Communist Chinese state-run energy firm. The CCP had 1.2 billion barrels when Biden took office, they have even more now. I cannot believe our President did that. If we let President Biden continue to run our oil this way, we will have nothing left. This has destroyed America's oil production. President Biden shut down the Keystone XL pipeline, destroying hundreds of thousands of American jobs. President Biden has allowed the least amount of federal land for drilling since the end of World War II. We are now producing 1 million barrels of oil less every day compared to when President Trump was in office. Every country faces natural disasters. Where will we get our oil next time we are in crisis? Whom will we have to beg to get our oil? China? Iran? The Saudis? Venezuela--like the Biden administration has already done? Or maybe even Russia? President Biden's actions prove an intentional plot to destroy America's oil industry and usher in the climate cult's Green New Deal. My amendment would simply strike the exceptions that Biden used to sell our oil. The American people don't believe that the President should have the authority to declare an emergency for any reason and then sell our oil to our enemies. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "while there is a great deal of divisive and partisan debate on the energy bill that is being considered this week, I rise to offer a bipartisan, commonsense, and straightforward amendment to protect U.S. national security in times of energy crisis.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats alike, to support this amendment and to include the bipartisan Banning Oil Exports to Foreign Adversaries Act in this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

President Trump imposed a decade-long ban in offshore drilling off the coast of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. Nothing in the underlying bill, H.R. 21, would change that. To be clear, nothing in H.R. 21 affects any existing statutory or regulatory restrictions that may prohibit offshore oil and gas development. The purpose and scope of the bill is limited. It is to protect the SPR from politically motivated drawdowns and to ensure the American people are protected from true emergencies in energy supply disruptions. It would require the Department of Energy to develop a plan. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and the underlying bill, H.R. 21.",

The purpose and scope of this bill is limited: it is to protect our SPR from political use and to ensure we are adequately prepared for future legitimate emergencies. It does nothing to impact existing Department of the Interior regulations. It simply requires the Secretary of Energy to develop a plan to increase production if it is used without declaring an emergency. This is not a vehicle to impose new restrictions.

              "it is interesting to hear this isn't really about energy or we would be talking about more than just a few tanks in the country. That is a really interesting phrase. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is put in for strategic reasons for the entire country, not for political gain. This amendment would prohibit oil and gas companies from producing on a lease outlined in the leasing plan unless the fossil industry entity submits to the Secretary of Energy a plan to reduce its global warming pollution. This amendment is simply nothing more than to delay the implementation of H.R. 21. That is all this is. Let's call it what it is. It is not about a few tanks in the country. Really? It is not about that. Americans are suffering under record-high gas prices that hurt low- income Americans the most, and they want to call that, oh, a discussion about a few tanks in the country. Really? Families can't put food on their tables. They can't put gas in their tanks. They are struggling to get by. Oh, this is just a discussion about a few tanks in America, that is all. Mr. Speaker, we have the strongest environmental and safety standards in the world, bar none. Let's let American energy workers do their job, make America safe, and make the world cleaner.

              "I rise in support of the amendment. During our markup of this bill in the committee, Representative Gosar offered a similar amendment to this one, though it applied only to oil and gas, not mining. I asked if he would consider adding mining to that ban, but that was declined. I also had an amendment to this bill to include mining in this ban, which was not made in order. However, this Republican amendment, which is very similar to my own, was made in order. I am glad to see that at least some Republicans have come around to the point of including mining as part of the ban. If we don't want the Chinese Communist Party developing oil and gas leases on Federal land and water, then we shouldn't be supportive of the CCP mining our publicly owned minerals. It isn't hard to find that many foreign-owned parent companies have terrible records of human rights abuses, environmental degradation, harming indigenous communities, and destroying sacred sites. Some foreign companies, specifically several owned by the Government of China, are known to have horrible records on all of these fronts, yet they can operate freely on our Federal land, including in my home State of Arizona, through their subsidiaries. I have repeatedly heard from my colleagues that we agree that human rights and environmental abuses are wrong, but so far, they have refused to address the problem. As the demand for these minerals increases, let's not rush to open our lands to just anyone who wants to mine. Let's take a closer look at who is operating on our Federal lands and work to raise the global standard. Let me remind Members that under our outdated 150-year-old mining law, mining claimants do not pay a cent, not one penny, for the public's valuable resources that they extract and turn around and sell--nothing. That is a better deal than even oil and gas get. We absolutely should not be handing our public mineral resources over to the CCP with no fair return to the American people, no return to the American people at all, where the result would be simply just to destroy our lands. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I rise today in support of my amendment, which is imperative to bringing home an essential supply chain and protecting our national security, all while protecting the environment. Rare earth elements and critical minerals are essential components in the daily lives of Americans, as well as in national security technology from home computers, televisions, and vehicles, to major weapons systems, including lasers, guided missile systems, jet engines, and alloys for armored vehicles. Currently, China controls the bulk of the global supply of these critical minerals and rare earths that support America's economy and defense industrial base. The demand for these minerals will steadily increase as the global economy adopts new technologies, placing the United States and its allies at a growing disadvantage unless steps are taken to shift production and sourcing away from Chinese Communist Party-controlled entities. The risk of supply disruptions is amplified by U.S. dependence on unreliable foreign sources and red tape that disincentivizes domestic sourcing. It is estimated that 80 percent of rare earth minerals in the United States come from China. For too long, bureaucratic red tape and uncertainty in the permitting process forced critical mineral and rare earth operations overseas. This amendment works to jump-start American critical mineral, rare- earth element, and carbon production to make our supply chains more resilient while creating opportunities for coal and coal byproducts to be used in new, clean, and innovative ways. According to Bureau of Land Management estimates, there are nearly 5,200 coal-related abandoned mine sites that have yet to be fully reclaimed. Through this amendment, we are creating an avenue for rare earths to be extracted from coal waste at these abandoned mine sites. This would not only help the United States with this critical supply chain need but also address our Nation's environmental and reclamation needs. Specifically, this amendment would include projects related to extraction, recovery, or processing of critical minerals, rare earth elements, or carbon from coal, coal waste, coal processing waste, or pre- or post-combustion coal byproducts, or acid mine drainage from coal mines as covered projects eligible for FAST-41 permitting for the purposes of securing the economic and national security of the United States. Mr. Speaker, whether you are like me, a member of the Congressional Coal Caucus or a member of the Sustainable Energy Caucus or a national security hawk or a member of the Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, every Member of Congress should be for this win-win-win solution, a win to reclaim these abandoned mine sites and fix an environmental problem, a win for the coal industry and the workers in the coal industry who need alternatives to combustion of coal now that we are in the transition phase of our energy development in our country, and certainly a win for national security. This is a way for us to end overdependence on the Chinese Communist Party for critical, national security sensitive supply chain needs. The United States must innovate and secure its supply chain of sensitive strategic materials in order to reduce reliance on Chinese Communist Party-controlled materials overseas. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``aye'' on my amendment, which I expect to be fully bipartisan, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this amendment. It is well known by now that foreign nations, China in particular, are dominating global supply chains for hardrock minerals like copper, nickel, lithium, and dozens of others. China's overwhelming presence in the minerals marketplace is not due to an inherent advantage in mineral reserves but instead is the result of a decades-long strategy to take control of dozens of commodities, from mining to manufacturing. For instance, China's ``go global'' strategy, which began in the 1990s, included $390 billion in outbound direct investments in the mining sector. Today, China is the primary global supplier of cobalt for batteries, despite having very limited domestic reserves, through its aggressive investment and processing capacity and foreign direct investment in mines around the world. China also has billions invested in nickel projects in Indonesia, home to one-quarter of overall global reserves. Nickel and cobalt are only two out of dozens of minerals that will see surging demand in the coming years. Examples of China's mineral dominance go on and on. Just yesterday, DOI Secretary Haaland testified before the House Appropriations Committee, where she agreed that electric vehicles and renewables deepen our dependence on China. Congressman Reschenthaler specifically asked Secretary Haaland if electric vehicles and renewables deepen our dependence on China, and she replied yes. We must not put China over America. We must return our Nation to energy independence. H.R. 1 combats the crisis of Chinese control of the global mineral supply chain. My colleague's amendment is a great addition to H.R. 1. The amendment directs the U.S. Geological Survey and the Departments of Defense, Energy, and State to identify the mineral supply chains needed for military, defense, and national security purposes that are at greatest risk of disruption because of China. Once identified, the administration must develop a strategy to bring these supply chains back to the United States, including through bolstering U.S. domestic mining, refining, processing, and manufacturing. This amendment speaks to the core of the bill under consideration today, the need to increase the domestic production of energy and minerals, a critical part of maintaining our national security. I support this amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting its inclusion in the package. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "I am thrilled to co-sponsor the ``Renewable Fuel for Ocean-Going Vessels Act'' (H.R. 6681), with Representatives Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA01), Nikki Budzinski (D- IL13), and Carlos A. Gimenez (R-FL28). This bipartisan bill would make maritime biofuel fully eligible under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Renewable Fuel Standard, which currently only applies to biofuels for motor vehicles, airplanes, locomotives and, in limited circumstances, recreational boating or vessels on inland waterways. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-58), Congress authorized the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which works to simultaneously reduce transportation-related emissions from fossil fuels and support domestic agriculture, forestry, and biofuels manufacturing. However, current law excludes otherwise eligible biofuels for ocean-going vessels. No rationale was ever provided for this exclusion in the Congressional hearing record or Committee reports for the 2005 and 2007 Energy Bills. This arbitrary, counterproductive exclusion denies the burgeoning advanced biofuels and renewable natural gas industries in the United States important maritime customers. Our bipartisan bill would fix this problem by simply striking the exclusion, allowing domestic biofuels producers to obtain an RFS credit for selling to customers in the Jones Act and global maritime industries. The United States Navy has even sought to use renewable maritime fuels but has so far been stymied as domestic blenders simply do not make renewable maritime fuel because of this unnecessary exclusion. To be clear, although modern engines for large vessels are increasingly capable of burning advanced biofuels instead of heavy bunker fossil fuels, our bipartisan bill would not require the use of renewable fuel in all ocean-going vessels. Instead, our bill would merely expand the potential market for biofuels and remove a statutory disincentive for developing renewable maritime fuels. According to the USEPA's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks from 1990 to 2021, the transportation sector accounted for approximately 29 percent of greenhouse gas emissions nationally, the largest of any economic sector. Tackling the climate crisis requires every industry to transition to cleaner, renewable fuels including the international ocean shipping and cruise industries. In July 2023, the United Nations International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted new global standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from commercial cargo vessels and cruise ships. Our bipartisan ``Renewable Fuel for Ocean-Going Vessels Act'' (H.R. 6681) would support the global maritime industry's transition to alternative fuels like advanced biofuels and renewable natural gas from methane capture. Mr. Speaker, the federal Renewable Fuel Standard's exclusion of fuel for ocean-going vessels, without any stated rationale, has created unnecessary regulatory complexity, hindered the advanced biofuel and renewable natural gas industries, and undermined the global effort to reduce maritime emissions. I encourage all Members of Congress to join me in removing this outdated restriction by cosponsoring our bipartisan the ``Renewable Fuel for Ocean-Going Vessels Act'' (H.R. 6681).",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, which includes the Water Quality Certification and Energy Project Improvement Act. That bill is the one that I introduced alongside my friend and colleague from Louisiana, Mr. Garret Graves. One of many key components in this package, this specific part of the bill helps ensure development of our Nation's energy infrastructure at a time when it is most necessary. This is accomplished by clarifying that projects subject to section 401 of the Clean Water Act are approved or denied based on water quality alone. Unlike what my colleagues have been saying on the other side of the aisle that we are going to permit dirty water, et cetera, et cetera, if it is related to water, guess what, section 401 still applies. The water quality certification process has been and continues to be weaponized by certain States to stifle important energy projects they oppose, particularly pipelines, for political reasons completely unrelated to water quality and outside the scope and the intent of the Clean Water Act. That is all this particular provision addresses. Instead of fairly analyzing a project based on the Federal standards set forth by Congress, what has happened is States on the East and West Coast have increasingly weaponized section 401 for their own ideological purposes, again totally and completely unrelated to water quality. Here are some examples: In my home State of North Carolina, the Mountain Valley Southgate project was denied, not because of water quality but because the deciding bureaucrats hold an inherent opposition to the project as a whole. Projects in Washington and New York have been denied due to noise and cultural resources. Nothing to do with water quality. These are just a few examples of the weaponization of section 401 of the Clean Water Act statute. The language that is included here in this package quite simply will end this abuse. At a time when American energy production and distribution is under tremendous assault from some in this country, ensuring that America can build the energy infrastructure necessary to responsibly utilize our natural resources, unleash American energy independence, and lower costs for American families is a top priority that this broader bill achieves. Let me put it this way: Low cost, reliable energy is fundamental to prosperity. It isn't the only critical aspect necessary for a nation and her people to be prosperous, but it is awfully hard for a nation to be prosperous without it. Low cost and reliable energy helps America to produce more goods and therefore put downward pressure on inflation, and, boy, do we need all the help we can get. It will enable America to be energy dominant again, increasing American strength abroad. Put another way, it is critical to our economy, our food security, and our national security. That is why this legislation is so badly needed at this critical time in American history. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Lower Energy Costs Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of clean water and in support of the Clean Water Act, and in opposition to H.R. 1, the polluters over people act. Clean water is a basic human right--the health and safety of our communities and the success of our economy depends on it. House Democrats stand for clean water. Last Congress, we passed a historic and bipartisan investment in our Nation's infrastructure through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The BIL included almost $13 billion in clean water infrastructure upgrades and is creating jobs in communities across the country. The Clean Water Act, passed in 1972, is one of the most successful environmental laws in our Nation's history. It has protected rivers, lakes, and streams from pollution and contamination, ensuring that we have access to clean and safe water. Section 401 of the Clean Water Act allows States to review projects that could impact their water quality. For 50 years, States have used this authority to protect their water resources, and it has helped them ensure that projects move forward only if clean water would not be compromised as a result. These proposals that are in H.R. 1, to narrow the scope of section 401, are a misguided effort at permitting reform. By limiting the ability of States to review projects, we are sacrificing the health of our communities and our environment for the sake of expedience and profit. I recognize the majority's interest in ensuring that permitting requirements are not insurmountable barriers to investment. I share the goal of speeding up project delivery. Last Congress, I supported not only the BIL, but also the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. These laws showed what Congress is capable of when it focuses on addressing the real needs of American families. I want these laws and their investments to be successful. However, to quickly put these investments to work, we need a robust partnership between the Federal Government and its State and local partners and Tribal partners, to address State, local, and Tribal requirements, and to ensure community buy-in before these investments are implemented. To be effective, that process must build on a mutual trust between the parties because any effort to force that process often results in opposition, delay, and litigation. Yet, H.R. 1 misses the mark by stifling local participation and buy- in, which will only result in these projects taking longer to implement. In fact, State organizations, such as the Western States Water Council, believe that placing arbitrary and strict limits on section 401 application review times and processes will require the States ``to issue an increased number of denials, due to inflexible deadlines that do not accommodate State public engagement laws or allow sufficient time to gather adequate information on project impacts.'' Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 1, and reject the efforts to weaken the Clean Water Act and our Nation's other bedrock environmental laws. We must protect our water resources for future generations and for the health of today's communities and families. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "I rise in support of H.R. 1, which will reinsert America back to its proper place as the world's leader in energy and critical mineral production. My home State of Idaho is blessed to be rich in natural resources, especially when it comes to critical minerals. Right now, there are revolutionary innovations in technology industries, transportation, and healthcare, and they all have one thing in common: an increasing need for certain critical minerals. Idaho contains an abundance of these minerals, including cobalt, lithium, and antimony. These resources not only can help the United States meet domestic demand, but they can also help fulfill global demand and bring prosperity to communities lacking high-paying jobs. As part of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I voted for many of these provisions in H.R. 1 that support access to critical minerals in American soil and require the Department of Energy to identify resources vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. Unfortunately, the Biden administration has proliferated policies that have ceded America's place as a responsible, productive source of critical minerals to foreign nations, many of which are hostile to Americans. For example, instead of Idaho and America producing the world's antimony, China and Russia account for more than 75 percent of the world's supply. Instead of Idaho and America fulfilling the global demand for cobalt, it comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a country with a horrifically bad human rights record. That has to change. Mr. Speaker, today, we offer Americans an all-of-the-above energy strategy that will reverse the America last policies currently in place. H.R. 1 will secure domestic energy supply and allow America to control its own destiny by restoring its position as a global leader in production.",
              "I rise in strong support of this amendment, which creates a national strategy for America to reshore our mineral supply chains. Mr. Speaker, I want to just reiterate what the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee just said. Yesterday, the Secretary of the Interior of this Nation, who is in charge of millions of acres of Federal land, when asked on a mineral withdrawal in the biggest cooper- nickel find in the world, in northeastern Minnesota, called the Duluth Complex--which has 95 percent of this Nation's nickel reserve, almost 90 percent of the cobalt reserve, 75 percent of the platinum root metals, and a third of our copper--when the Secretary of the Interior yesterday was asked if there is critical minerals in that find, this is her answer: I don't know what kind of minerals were there. I don't think there were critical minerals. The Secretary of the Interior has no idea that cobalt and nickel are part of the critical minerals, of the 37 critical minerals identified by the Department of Energy. This is her response. We need a national strategy to reshore these minerals. I want to reiterate: This is offensive to my constituents who are ready and able to mine these critical minerals to secure our supply chain for this Nation. We have to secure our supply chain. We have to hold the dependency of this great Nation in the palm of our own hand, doing it with the best environmental standards and the best labor standards. We can't allow China to dominate in our critical minerals with zero environmental standards and zero labor standards. The Communist country of China owns 15 of the 19 industrial mines in the Congo that use child slave labor, and this administration just entered into a memorandum of understanding to allow child slaves to mine the minerals that we need. We can't do this anymore as the United States of America. We should never allow or purchase minerals mined by child slave labor. Again, this is the Secretary of the Interior of the United States of America. She has no idea what is happening with the withdrawal.",
              "energy is the most important element of a prosperous society. Nothing else functions without it. Reliable electricity allows us to work at night, keep our sick and injured on life support, heat our homes in freezing weather, manufacture the materials that we use to build our homes, and powers the systems that allow the public to watch these remarks right here on this House floor. Energy is connected to everything. The price of energy affects the price of everything else, and the world devolves into the Dark Ages without it. This might explain why Republicans think an energy bill should be labeled H.R. 1--because it is our number one priority, as it should be. We have to introduce this bill because, bewilderingly, energy security has been under relentless attack by radical leftists and the Biden administration. They don't believe in energy security. They don't believe in reliable, affordable energy. They seem to think that the only energy worth pursuing is so-called renewables, solar and wind. This is not sound policy or science. This has become a religion, and it has become an irrational pursuit of intermittent, weather-dependent energy sources that take up vast amounts of land, vast amounts of resources to make, and vast amounts of critical minerals to be mined. Still, it doesn't deliver the energy security the American people need. I am not against these things. It would be fine to pursue these technologies if it didn't also come with a simultaneous attack on the sources of energy that actually work--namely, oil and gas. Every good thing you have in this world, Mr. Speaker, is because of petroleum products--every single thing. Your shoes, your cars, your iPhones, your Netflix, your Patagonia jackets, medical devices that save your life, your heating, your cooling--literally everything comes from petroleum products. The attack on oil and gas has been relentless, and it has been deeply foolish. It started with day one of the Biden administration and the Keystone pipeline, then executive orders banning new leases on Federal lands, and then refusal to permit pipelines. Then they turn around and attack the suppliers and producers for higher prices. It is pure gaslighting. They have drained our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, all while prioritizing the same crazy climate policies that have caused Europe to enter an energy crisis and that are now causing developing nations to be priced out of gas markets and turn to coal production. This gets me to quite the irony here. The administration's policies are more likely to increase global carbon emissions as a result, and for one simple reason. I really want everyone to understand this. By refusing to push for increased natural gas exports, we are shelving the best tool for displacing coal power around the world. Coal burned in foreign countries accounts for about 50 percent of global power emissions. Natural gas is an easy substitute with half the emissions. American natural gas could easily be leveraged to increase prosperity for all and reduce emissions. This is not rocket science. It is common sense. It is just math. Promoting American natural gas is better for energy security, better for our own affordability, and better for reducing global emissions. There is no logical counterargument to what I just said. There is not one. Maybe--I believe this--the Biden administration actually knows this. That is why they prefer oil production in foreign countries and beg them to drill so that we can pretend we care about the climate while allowing other countries to do the dirty work for us."

              "I heard my colleague from our committee say that this was a perfecting amendment, and what I see it as is just a more bureaucracy amendment. The problem here with the underlying bill is that it basically makes it impossible for the President to use--to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when there is an emergency in order to lower prices or to increase the supply. What this amendment does is to put even more restrictions or make it even more likely that a delay would occur because the gentleman says that the plan required would include a list of parcels planned to be offered for lease, including for each parcel, the size of the parcel by acre, the location of the parcel, any permits and approvals necessary to access the parcel, and produce oil and gas on the parcel. Look, the bottom line is what it appears the sponsor wants is for the Federal Government to spend its limited time during a crisis looking over maps of critical public lands and drawing arbitrary lines instead of taking rapid actions to lower gas prices for everyday families. The underlying bill doesn't work because it puts all kinds of restrictions on the President's ability to use the reserve, either to lower prices, or to increase the supply in an emergency, and this amendment only makes it worse. It would throw more barriers to the Secretary using the reserve to protect American families and businesses. It is so shortsighted, considering how critical the Biden administration's use of the reserve has been following Putin's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent global gas shortages. For a minority so concerned--I should say in this case, for a Republican majority so concerned with cutting red tape, this amendment would create quite a few unnecessary hoops for the Secretary to jump through before taking swift action to help Americans. It just makes no sense. Again, over the past year, the Biden administration has demonstrated that in an emergency, in an energy crisis, strategic use of the reserve can bring relief to the pump for millions of Americans, and this amendment puts that record of success by the Biden administration in jeopardy. So I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment and, of course, a ``no'' vote on final passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment is simple and straightforward. My amendment simply requires the administration to submit their plan to increase oil and gas production on Federal lands to the House Committees on Armed Services, Agriculture, and Energy and Commerce and Natural Resources, as well as the Senate Committees on Energy and Natural Resources, Environment and Public Works, Armed Services, and Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. This simple, good-governance amendment allows Congress to take back its Article I authority in our system of checks and balances. Without my amendment, the plan to bolster our domestic energy supply will be filed away and never seen again. This amendment will provide transparency for the administration to carry out its congressionally authorized duty. More than 55 percent of my Congressional District is Federal land and accounts for nearly 44 percent of Colorado's natural gas production. The underlying bill requires the administration to be responsible for their actions. If Joe Biden and Secretary Granholm continue to dip into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, they must have a plan in place to increase oil and gas production on land that has been locked up and overregulated by the Federal Government. That plan should be submitted to the congressional committees of jurisdiction. By requiring the administration to submit its plan to the people's House, we can provide important oversight as to how the administration will carry out this plan and provide feedback. On the Western Slope of Colorado, we have seen firsthand the harm leftist policies have created in our communities, literally regulating our communities into poverty. With the stroke of his pen, Joe Biden unilaterally locked up Federal lands for oil and gas production and development. Colorado's Western Slope used to have a booming energy production economy. We used to have 112 drilling rigs on the Western Slope, and now we have 4. These extreme leftist policies to lock up land have driven away those good-paying jobs and have helped drive up gas prices. Congress needs to take back its power and advocate for the American people they represent. My amendment will ensure those voices do not go unheard and that we will hold the administration accountable for the responsible energy plan required by this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I rise today to offer an amendment to the Strategic Production Response Act. The purpose of this bill is to use our strategic national stockpile of oil so that Big Oil can keep profiting at the expense of hardworking families. Let's remember, the purpose of the strategic stockpile is to protect national security and to reduce prices at the pump for the American people. My amendment would require the Secretary of Energy to certify that the plan to increase oil and gas leasing on Federal lands is necessary to restore our stockpile to protect our national security. My amendment would let this or any future administration have the flexibility it needs if we reach another energy crisis. When the people of my district and across the country were facing sky-high prices at the gas pump, President Biden tapped into our strategic stockpiles to ease the prices at the pump and gave working families the financial help that they needed at the time when they needed it. Now, instead of protecting national security and helping reduce inflation, Republicans are trying to take away the tools that we have to help hardworking Americans. Last Congress, Democrats passed several bills to reduce inflation: Over 80,000 families with children in the Inland Empire received monthly payments of up to $300 thanks to the child tax credit. We also created good-paying jobs with the passage of a once-in-a- generation infrastructure bill that invests in our construction and transportation industries and ensures people have access to the education and training necessary to secure good jobs. We passed legislation to bring down the cost of healthcare, lower prescription drug costs, cap the price of insulin and expanded coverage for hearing aids, which would benefit everyone, especially the 85,000 Medicare-eligible seniors in my district. Why are we here trying to pass a bill to help the Big Oil corporations that will force Americans to pay more at the pump? Republicans are so out of touch that they have put before us a bill that ties the President's hands and restricts him from using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve even if Americans desperately need the help. I ask my colleagues to vote in support of my amendment to require the Energy Secretary to certify that this oil and gas drilling is necessary to replenish the strategic stockpile because that is what we should be focusing on, ensuring that we have the appropriate tools to protect our national security and Americans' wallets, not the Big Oil corporations' bottom line. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

              "as much as I appreciate Mr. Levin and his real sincerity and work on the committee, on this bill, and his expertise in this area, I must oppose this amendment tonight and hope to work with him on some additional legislation in the future. This amendment would strike all of the provisions in division B that increase domestic energy production and reduce energy costs for American families. This amendment prevents division B from going into effect until all of the Federal agencies impacted certify that they have adequate funding and staffing to meet the timelines in the bill. In response, I ask a simple question: When has a Federal bureaucracy ever felt it has enough staff on its payroll or enough taxpayer dollars to spend in its budget? The answer is never, at least not as long as I have been in Congress and I have talked to Federal agencies. Even with the spending push by the Democrats in the so-called Inflation Reduction Act--they have stated several times during the debate on H.R. 1 that they have put a billion dollars out there to speed up permitting--these Federal agencies are still asking for more money and more staff, and permitting timelines are still ballooning. Why? Because the issue is not an issue of staffing or budget alone. The underlying statutes and the processes are broken, and they must be fixed. That is what H.R. 1 does. It addresses the underlying issues, and it will expedite permitting for all kinds of projects. This messaging amendment would prevent meaningful reforms in the name of growing the Federal bureaucracy. For these reasons, I oppose this amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in opposition. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).",
              "there is a way to speed up and deal with the backlog. We, Democrats, in the Inflation Reduction Act fought for and included $1 billion to deal specifically with NEPA and the review process to bring it up to capacity and staff it. The same can be done for the other agencies that do species reviews, marine reviews, et cetera. It can be done and it needs to be done by the government. I think the Federal Government should have the sole responsibility to conduct unbiased environmental reviews. That would deal with the backlog. With the $1 billion under NEPA, we will reach that 2-year threshold that the Trump administration wanted, that the Republican majority wanted, and Senators, including Manchin, wanted. We can do the same with the other agencies as well. It is about backlog. It is not about continuing a self-fulfilling prophesy. The prophesy has been to starve these departments so that you can claim that things are not being done in a timely fashion. This is an opportunity. The President has recommended it in his budget to fully allow the transfer of money from the IRA to this review process with other agencies, not just NEPA. I think this amendment is redundant in the sense that we establish a dependency on outside funding from potential claimants to leases and permits within our Federal lands and waters and depend on them to be able to deal with that backlog. If we are going to speed this up, let's do it correctly. Let's do it with the taxpayer and the American public's rights and public health in mind and fund them fully. We should allow the President and the departments to transfer money to the areas in which they are needed. That is what speeds it up. What we are doing today in terms of requiring a report will have no real effect on the backlog and opens the doors to conflicts of interest and corruption in our permitting process. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment simply requires Federal agencies to certify that they have the staffing capacity to meet the new environmental timelines established under this bill. According to the Government Accountability Office, the main reason for project delays at the Federal level is a lack of agency resources and staff capacity. Thankfully, we helped address this challenge by securing $1 billion in the IRA to ensure Federal agencies have the resources and expertise to conduct efficient environmental reviews. A trained, equipped workforce is essential to processing environmental reviews in a timely fashion in cases where there are delays. Increasing the funding and staff for Federal agencies' permitting offices and agency workforce training is already making the permitting process significantly more effective and efficient in a responsible way. Unfortunately, instead of building on the progress we made in the Inflation Reduction Act and supporting agencies' capacity to conduct reviews by providing additional resources, H.R. 1 takes the more politically expedient but impractical approach of simply forcing agencies onto stricter timelines for reviews without providing additional resources for Federal agencies to conduct these reviews. By instituting these strict deadlines and limiting opportunities for community input throughout this bill, I am worried that instead of leading to more efficient project reviews and approvals, H.R. 1 may actually lead to sloppier and rushed reviews. When environmental reviews are not thorough, projects often face a litany of time- consuming lawsuits and litigation. As some may know, I used to work on clean energy projects before coming to Congress, and my own experience is that detailed environmental reviews and a thoughtful permitting process alongside early engagement with impacted communities can facilitate more efficient completion of projects and better overall outcomes. This amendment would help support efficient reviews by requiring that the Council on Environmental Quality in consultation with affected Federal agencies certify that all agencies have the funding and staffing capacity to meet the new timelines for environmental review required under the bill. It is common sense that we should not be instituting arbitrary timelines if agencies don't have the necessary resources to meet them. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to ensure that affected agencies have the resources needed to conduct high-quality reviews, which will lead to better overall project outcomes. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

              "House Democrats filed several amendments to H.R. 1 that would help mitigate some of the outright damage to our climate, our communities, and our economic future that this bill would cause. Unfortunately, only 7 out of 95 were made in order to get an open debate and an up-or-down vote. Some Republicans have also filed amendments that I support. But I am afraid that at the end of the day, there is ultimately no path forward for making H.R. 1 any semblance of a legislative proposal that the American people, not polluters, deserve. The polluters over people act will actively and aggressively take us backward regarding emissions and in our transition to clean energy. It guts our bedrock environmental laws and takes communities out of the permitting process entirely, the public's right to know. Some of the Republican amendments add to that mess. To start, I rise today in opposition to this amendment, which would make a harmful bill even worse by arbitrarily eroding community protections under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. This amendment greatly expands the limited environmental review standards of the 2015 FAST Act to a series of coal waste extraction activities that can cause significant environmental damage and warrant strong environmental review standards. There is already a deliberate process in place under the FAST Act to expand its limited environmental review standards to new types of projects under certain conditions. This amendment is a legislative end run around that deliberative process that inappropriately curtails public input, environmental review, and judicial review under NEPA. At its most basic level, NEPA simply requires government agencies to assess significant environmental and public health impacts before a decision is made and potentially harmful activities like coal waste extraction begin. NEPA doesn't stop these activities. It simply assures that their impacts are considered and that the public knows. This amendment undermines the basic purposes of NEPA. I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 1, the polluters over people act. Although energy independence and lower costs are laudable goals for any energy legislation, unfortunately, this bill achieves neither. Instead, H.R. 1 is a giveaway to Big Oil and their lobbyists, who want to be able to set their own rules at the expense of working families. Instead of putting the needs of the American public at the center of this bill, my friends across the aisle drafted an industry wish list. First, H.R. 1 undermines landmark environmental laws and protections like the Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Policy Act that safeguard public health and keep our drinking water and air clean. It also repeals the methane emissions reduction program, which helps companies reduce their methane pollution. This bill makes it easier for polluters to set their own standards and roll back reforms, and it lets Big Oil rubberstamp their own projects with minimal oversight. Environmental disasters are far too common, and unfortunately, H.R. 1 would make it easier for future disasters to happen. Second, the polluters over people act worsens the climate crisis by empowering the fossil fuel industry instead of strengthening the foundation for a clean energy future, which is so important. During the last Congress, the 117th Congress, we passed policies-- many bipartisan policies--like the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, that invested in climate action at a scale matching the challenge that science tells us that we face. This bill that we have before us today not only ignores the additional steps we need to take to reach our climate targets, but it actively takes us backward on climate action by rolling back key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, which was and is the most significant environmental and climate bill that has ever been passed in the United States or anywhere else. We know that data is alarming. A new U.N. report found that global warming could increase by 3.2 degrees Celsius and cause 7 feet of sea level rise by the end of the century if immediate actions are not taken. This is an existential crisis. Climate change is real. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle know it is real, and we cannot continue to deny this and put our planet at risk with this type of legislation. Instead of wasting time on this Big Oil wish list, I would like for us, instead, to focus on actions that will actually expand the employment of clean energy, reduce costs, expand high-capacity transmission, reform the interconnection process, and build on the $1 billion that we secured in the Inflation Reduction Act to ensure that Federal agencies have the resources and expertise to conduct efficient environmental reviews. Third, H.R. 1 adds to the deficit. That is right, it adds to the deficit by giving handouts to big oil and gas corporations so that their executives and their shareholders can get even richer. For a party that is focused--at least, I hear that they are--on tackling the deficit, I think it is pretty extraordinary that this legislation, their signature legislation would add to the deficit. Last year, when Americans were dealing with high costs at the pump, fossil fuel executives were taking in record profits. In fact, 26 of the country's largest oil companies made a record-breaking $451 billion last year, just last year, and they spent over $163 billion on stock buybacks and dividends to their shareholders. These same companies donated over $370,000 to my friends across the aisle, so it is no wonder they want to reward their friends. It is clear that this legislation, the polluters over people act, is another giveaway, to keep corporations rich at the American people's expense without making meaningful reforms. In fact, while making things worse. For all these reasons and more, I strongly oppose this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I proposed four amendments that would begin to correct course, but unfortunately my friends across the aisle are only allowing two of those amendments to come to the floor. My first amendment that was blocked would clarify that lead Federal agencies can extend a public comment period or gather further community input if the Secretary determines that doing so would improve project results or efficiency. This would allow agencies to actually streamline the permitting process by ensuring that potentially impacted communities and local governments have the ability to fully engage in the process. Instead, my friends across the aisle chose to block consideration of this amendment and perpetuate the myth--it is a myth--that community input somehow slows down project approvals. My other amendment that was blocked would have banned offshore drilling off the southern California coast. Californians of both political parties have made it absolutely clear, overwhelmingly clear that they are strongly opposed to additional offshore oil and gas drilling in southern California off the coast. This amendment would have offered this Congress an opportunity to respect the will of the overwhelming majority of Californians who oppose drilling off our coasts. I strongly urge my friends across the aisle, allow debate on these and other amendments so that more voices are heard. As my colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee have heard me say before, I am willing to work with anyone--anyone--on either side of the aisle to meet the goals of lowering energy costs and protecting our planet, particularly in terms of promoting a more efficient and transparent permitting process. I hope we can do that. We can find common ground on pragmatic solutions. This is not common ground. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no.''",
              "I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 1, House Republicans' polluters over people act. When the House Democratic majority passed the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, they delivered key environmental safeguards to bolster our clean energy economy and lower costs. The legislation that Republicans are bringing to the floor attempts to undermine those promising provisions because of political animus. Instead of trying to meet the needs of the American taxpayer, they are working to line the pockets of fossil fuel tycoons and exacerbate toxic mining projects that directly harm communities like mine. H.R. 1 is not about the people, it is about a political win, and it is hooey. This legislation would undo significant environmental regulations central to our public health and environmental protections at a time when people are facing an alarming pattern of severe weather, lack of access to clean water and air, and blatant pollution across the country. Pollution kills people. I can tell you that no one here is breathing dirty air. No one here is drinking dirty water. No one here is growing anything in dirty soil. If we are not, that means that no one else should be forced to do so. It would roll back the environmental review processes under NEPA, putting community health and safety at risk while worsening pollution and the health risks associated with toxic chemicals such as PFAS, the same forever chemicals that are killing our firefighters. I urge you to listen to the committee hearings where you will hear them say there is no need for community engagement, polluters can self- monitor. That is why I was so disappointed but, oh, not surprised when Republicans voted down my amendment to include an environmental analysis and review of how oil and gas development will impact community health and safety because it will. Instead, Republicans are so eager to rush into free-for-all oil and gas development that they are unable to reckon with the serious health consequences they are pawning off onto our constituents. You would have more respect for a bill if they cared enough about the health and safety of your community, if they wanted to protect your child or your grandmother's health. Unfortunately, we know that the Black community is disproportionately impacted by environmental pollution. I have talked about what is going on in my district every single week. Black Americans are three times more likely to die of asthma after continued exposure to polluted air, a result of historic, systemic racism. This legislation makes it virtually impossible for impacted communities to file lawsuits against corporate polluters for environmental and public health damages, so it is killing your lungs and silencing your voice. It continues to put mining rights ahead of the interests of the community, especially in indigenous communities where mining was used to settle the West. This bill declares that indigenous communities shouldn't even be consulted about what is going on on their lands, to rip away lands from indigenous communities in favor of our own traditional, patriarchal, American individualistic interests. Even more than that, we have seen ties between environmental racism and increased rates of gender violence at these mining sites where indigenous women and girls are attacked by employees at the man camps. Now they don't even care about the safety of women and girls. Polling shows that two-thirds of Americans want legislation that addresses the climate crisis, proving once again that Republicans answer to special interests and not the will of the people. This is all about dirty money, profits over people, and it is disgraceful. Shame on them, Mr. Speaker, for deliberately ignoring the health of our people and the environment. I oppose this bill and any other fossil fuel cash grabs the Republicans send our way."

              "I rise in strong support of this bill because this legislation will restore and secure American energy independence. I am especially supportive of this bill's provisions to modernize the NEPA process. Look how long it takes for many of the permits to actually be approved. It streamlines the Federal permitting process for all industries. These commonsense reforms will provide the necessary certainty so projects across the Nation are carried out in a timely manner without sacrificing our environmental standards which are the most robust in the world. This will be critical for jurisdictions like mine in Puerto Rico, as we rebuild our public and energy infrastructure from recent natural disasters. Modernizing NEPA and the Federal permitting process--setting clear and reasonable timelines for agencies to conduct environmental reviews--will help simplify the process and reduce bureaucratic hurdles that too often have delayed our recovery process. This bill will also establish a revenue-sharing structure for offshore wind leases in Federal waters. I was proud to work with Chairman Westerman during our committee markup to secure language clarifying that both coastal States and territories will receive revenues from any Federal offshore wind development off their coasts. Specifically, this bill establishes a framework under which coastal States and territories will get funds for these offshore wind revenues. This bill further requires that States and territories invest these funds in coastal protection and resiliency projects, such as hurricane and flood protection, restoration, conservation, beach nourishment, and estuary management. Therefore, this is not just an energy security and permitting reform package. This is also a coastal resiliency bill. For that reason, and knowing that we got billions of dollars in Federal funding for reconstructing the island, this is the process we need, this is the reform we actually need to get those funds in hand. I thank and commend Majority Leader Scalise, Chair Westerman, Chair Rodgers and Chair Graves for their leadership and work on this important, powerful legislation. I wish I could vote for this bill on the floor of the House today, but as a territory delegate I cannot, but I support this bill.",
              "I am going to be honest. I am at a loss for words. This bill, the polluters over people act, is bad for the consumers, bad for the environment, and bad for the U.S. economy. You wouldn't know that from the rhetoric across the aisle, leaving me to wonder whether they are all lying or just ignorant. I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt here and assume they are ignorant. Since I am at a loss for words, as I said, I am going to try to explain this with some numbers. Since 2010, the United States economy has grown by $7 trillion. That is about 50 percent. During the same period, natural gas consumption in our country is up 25 percent, only half as much. Petroleum consumption is flat. Coal consumption is down by 40 percent. This is awesome news. We should all be celebrating. We have decoupled economic growth from fossil fuel consumption. We can grow without depending on environmental degradation. The environment and American energy consumers are winning. That is not because they are using less energy. It is because they are not paying for it. You don't pay for solar energy. You don't pay for energy efficiency. Remember, no one wants a barrel of oil. What you want is a cold beer and a hot shower. Now, Americans are getting more of the latter with less of the former, and if that confuses anybody in this body, then I would encourage you to go ask your local 6-year-old, what would you rather have on Christmas morning; a warm fire and some twinkly lights or a big old lump of coal? Like I said, this isn't that complicated. Let us now ask what the fossil fuel industry has done in the wake of their collapsing market share. Did they pivot to providing things consumers want--cleaner, cheaper energy? Did they redeploy their capital into solar, wind, geothermal, electric vehicle charging stations? Of course not. They moved to strip-mine the United States and asked for your acceleration of their work. During the same period, U.S. exports of oil have grown by a factor of four. U.S. exports of natural gas have grown by a factor of six. Their revenues that Mr. Levin talked about are not going up because they are selling more of their product to Americans, it is because they are strip-mining America and selling it overseas. Exporting U.S. energy does not lower the price of energy in the United States. If anything, it raises costs to American consumers because you reduce domestic supply, for goodness sakes. This bill would only make that worse. To be sure, there are real challenges facing U.S. energy consumers. We have an aging grid. We need transmission to connect renewables to load. We have got the growth in electric demand thanks to all those EVs and heat pumps. We should be focusing on those challenges if we are looking out for the American consumer, but this bill does not give a damn about the American consumer. Its sole purpose is to transfer wealth from the American taxpayer to American energy exporters. There are a small number of Americans whose wealth depends on oil and gas production and export--you all know them by name, I am sure--but every single American benefits from cheaper energy, and if you are going to claim to support the interests of the latter, vote ``no'' on this bill. If you are voting ``yes,'' at least have the dignity to be honest about whose interests you are looking out for.",
              "This amendment stops any offshore wind lease sales in the waters around Florida until the Government Accountability Office publishes a report on the impacts of wind energy development on military readiness, the marine environment, and tourism. I find the amendment somewhat ironic in that H.R. 1, the polluters over people act, guts the National Environmental Policy Act, which is the best tool for thoroughly studying the impacts of major projects like offshore wind. A robust NEPA process will evaluate the potential impacts of offshore wind projects on military activities, fisheries, marine life, tourism, and coastal communities. NEPA is the tool our government should use to help identify the best places for offshore wind and how to mitigate any potential impacts. With all due respect to the GAO, a couple-page GAO study on the potential impacts of offshore wind doesn't make up for a thorough, robust NEPA review. We need to make sure that coastal communities have the tools that NEPA offers to weigh in on projects that may affect their coastlines and their marine resources. Speaking of NEPA, my colleague referenced a project. According to Politico, ``But look at the energy project that Republicans are citing as their poster child for the problem sheds light on where their push may or may not help speed project approvals. ``GOP lawmakers focused on delays to the Cardinal-Hickory Creek transmission line during a legislative hearing last month, blaming the NEPA process for years of delay that have stymied a 102-mile power project from Wisconsin to Iowa. Yet, Republican's proposed changes `would not impact' the project, said Rod Pritchard, a spokepersons for the power line's developer, ITC Midwest.'' H.R. 1 guts NEPA, begins dismantling it, weakens it, and cuts the public out of the process. This amendment protects Florida and their coastline. There are other coastlines and other communities that don't want extraction such as gas and oil. I mentioned California and States along the Atlantic, and they should be extended. They fight every day to preserve those areas. Mr. Speaker, I oppose the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time."

              "I rise to offer an amendment to the Strategic Production Reserve Act to prohibit the Secretary of Energy from approving new oil and gas leases on Federal lands that have high concentrations of orphaned oil and gas wells. Over the 160-year history of industrial oil and gas extraction in the United States, companies have dug millions of oil wells to fuel energy demands at home and around the world. When the pumps run dry and the wells are no longer profitable, companies are supposed to seal them up to stop toxic chemicals from escaping into the environment. Unfortunately, they often have not. Between the lax regulations of the oil boom and the patchwork of current State and Federal laws, oil companies have been able to shirk their responsibility to keep the communities around their wells safe. Today, the American landscape is dotted with abandoned, uncapped wells that leak toxins into the air we breathe and the water we drink. The U.S. Geological Survey has documented more than 117,000 orphaned wells, and the EPA estimates that as many as 3 million could exist across the country. Last year, as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Congress authorized $4.7 billion in investment to plug orphaned wells and protect the areas around them from further environmental harm. But even with this funding, the government is playing whack-a-mole-- with new orphaned wells emerging as we struggle to clean up the ones we already have. Right now, as we debate this bill, the largest owner of oil and gas wells in the country is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy that could leave more than 70,000 orphaned wells spewing poison in different parts of the country. As taxpayers cover the tab for the mess that oil companies created, we should not be signing leases that open the door to a new generation of orphaned wells. My State of Texas is the top oil and gas producing State in the Nation, and I am acutely aware of how important the energy industry is to our State and our national economy. This amendment does not ask oil companies to repay taxpayers for the billions we have already spent to clean up their toxic wells, and it doesn't prevent further drilling. Instead, it pauses new drilling leases on Federal lands with the highest concentration of orphaned wells--giving the government a chance to catch up with the cleanup efforts that are already underway. This is a commonsense amendment that would bring relief to the 14 million Americans who live within a mile of an orphaned well. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I really hope this amendment can be bipartisan. I see no reason why it wouldn't be. It simply provides predictability for States applying for primacy of class 6 carbon capture wells. It is very straight forward. When a State submits a primacy application to the EPA, the EPA has 270 days to either approve or deny the application. If the EPA is unable to do so within that generous time window, we give them another 30 days to explain why. If, for whatever reason, the EPA fails to make a determination after 300 days, then the State can move forward. Importantly, we preserve EPA's ability to deny the application or revoke the approval using emergency measures under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Why is this needed? Unfortunately, when States submit primacy applications for these wells, it can take years for the EPA to even bother to review the application. There is a lot more demand for carbon capture projects. They are ramping up around the country, especially in Houston. The need for expanded permitting capacity has greatly increased. The EPA should not be the roadblock to projects that are designed to reduce carbon emissions. Let me say that again: Reduce carbon emissions. The International Energy Agency said carbon capture is necessary to meet national, regional, and even corporate emissions reductions goals. Even EPA administrator Michael Regan called carbon capture a priority for the Biden administration. It is a bipartisan issue. States like Texas have already proven they can manage these wells and giving them primacy will be a game changer for speeding up carbon capture projects. Giving States regulatory certainty is critical to successful carbon capture projects moving forward in their States. That is all this amendment does. Mr. Speaker, there is no reason why this should not be bipartisan, and I encourage my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "the gentleman from Texas' amendment would undermine EPAs critical Underground Injection Control program and endanger the health of communities around the Nation, in my opinion. The Underground Injection Control program, or UIC, regulates injection wells to protect drinking water sources. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA implements the program, but can delegate primary enforcement authority, or primacy, to a State. To be granted primacy, States must demonstrate to EPA that they, among other things, have regulations in place that meet various minimum requirements. The point of this application and EPA approval process is to ensure there is a Federal floor to regulations so drinking water is protected across the country. This amendment seeks to expedite approvals of primacy applications by effectively rubber-stamping State UIC programs for class 6 wells, those used for carbon sequestration, if EPA hasn't acted on the State application within the review period. Just like other permit deadline provisions of the polluters over peoples act, this would be dangerous. While this amendment targets class 6 wells used for underground injection of carbon dioxide, the text, as written, would apply to State program applications or program revisions for all well types, including hazardous waste injection wells. UIC programs should be rigorous and protective. We should not gamble with people's drinking water. Once water is contaminated, we cannot easily reverse course. If Republicans care about the implementation of this program, they would support EPA as it works to ensure robust State programs are in place before granting primacy. In fact, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $25 million toward that goal. So if States want primacy, they should complete the application process and be held to the Federal standard so Americans know their water is safe. Circumventing this process will only put communities in jeopardy. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this amendment and encourage my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act. My goal as the chair of Energy and Commerce Committee is to make sure Americans have access to affordable, reliable energy. This was a key promise in the House Republicans' ``Commitment to America,'' and we are hitting the ground running to deliver on that promise. This is just the beginning. Energy is foundational to everything. For centuries it has driven human progress and development. It is why America has done more to lift people out of poverty and raise the standard of living than anywhere else in the world. Today, over 3.7 billion people are living in energy poverty. That is half the world. They have a 10-year lower life expectancy, 35 percent fewer years of education, and many don't have electricity at all. Here in the United States of America, we are blessed with the ability and the resources to continue to raise the standard of living globally and even lift people out of poverty. Our goal today is to celebrate how our abundant energy resources have unleashed prosperity and invited people from around the world to come across the globe to America to achieve their hopes and dreams. We have accomplished this as a leader in reducing emissions and with the highest environmental and labor standards in the world. We cannot afford to move backward with a reckless command-and-control so-called climate agenda that forces people to pay more and go without reliable electricity. H.R. 1 prioritizes the American people over this radical climate agenda. On his first day in office, President Biden started a war on American energy. Predictably, gas prices skyrocketed to the highest levels in American history. President Biden revoked the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, imposed a moratorium on oil production on Federal lands, and directed agencies across the Federal Government to impose punitive and burdensome regulations. As the American people suffered, President Biden turned to OPEC and Russia to boost supplies. In the face of Russia's aggression, President Biden looked the other way and green-lit the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, emboldening Russia to attack Ukraine. The CCP now is deepening ties with Russia and consolidating its control over more than 90 percent of the world's critical mineral supplies. To win the future, we cannot allow our energy security to be surrendered to our adversaries. H.R. 1 sends the strong and unmistakable signal to restore American energy dominance and bolster our national security. H.R. 1 will unleash American energy, lower costs, and secure our supply chains. This package helps lift barriers to expanding our energy supplies, remove red tape for exporting and importing LNG, and build more pipelines with our North American allies and across the States. It would repeal President Biden's burdensome natural gas tax, which will harm communities, shut down production, and raise prices across the entire economy. H.R. 1 will encourage innovation and production of critical materials here at home to cut China out of our energy supply chains and ensure America is leading the world in innovation and next-generation energy technologies. We have heard a lot of talk, and Democrats are forcing a so-called transition that requires the American people to suffer through supply chains and price hikes. What Republicans are offering through H.R. 1 is a commitment to energy expansion that will deliver on lower costs and reliable and affordable energy. The fact is, higher costs are making life unaffordable for hardworking people in this country while forcing us to be dangerously reliant on Chinese supply chains that are dirtier and use slave labor. I think about the farmer who told us that this so-called climate agenda is raising the cost of food and making it harder for farmers to feed our families; an advocate who shared with our committee that record-high energy costs hurt low-income and minority families the most; and the mayor of Midland who told us her community is thriving because of the investment in jobs the oil and gas industry brings. We must embrace and expand America's position as the number one energy producer in the world while continuing our leadership to reduce emissions. People all over this Nation are counting on us for a better quality of life. With H.R. 1, we will boost energy production, lift regulatory burdens for the construction of more energy infrastructure, cut China out of our critical material supply chains, and lower costs across the board. This is how we build a more secure future for Americans. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 1, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I thank the chairwoman for her leadership on this bill. The Lower Energy Costs Act is a product of countless hours of discussion between leadership, stakeholders, and our constituents, who are tired of higher costs for less reliable energy. The United States has an incredible energy potential. We have vast resources of oil, natural gas, and other critical minerals essential for energy dominance. Only a few years ago, we were a global leader in both oil and gas production. This was achieved through American innovation, domestic energy production, and investment from the private sector in developing our critical energy infrastructure. Unfortunately, the Biden administration vowed to wage war on American energy. Starting on his very first day in office with the help of the Democrats here in Congress, the Biden administration has pursued radical rush-to-green energy policies that made energy less secure, less reliable, and more expensive for our constituents. This has led to increased costs of energy and goods, hitting the most vulnerable the hardest. We should be about increasing the standard of living for Americans versus diminishing the standard of living that these anti-American energy policies actually do. Energy is the foundation of everything in American life. When the cost of energy goes up, everything else does, as well. H.R. 1 should help America and will help America produce more, deliver more to our communities, and give us the ability to export and help our allies around the world. The American people recognize this, and they are sick of choosing between paying their energy bills and putting food on the table, which is why they gave us the majority, to stop this radical energy agenda. I am proud that my bill, Protecting American Energy Production Act, was included in this package. This provision will protect energy security and affordability by prohibiting the President from imposing a ban on hydraulic fracturing. The discovery of natural gas through the shale revolution has made the United States a leader in energy production as well as emissions reduction and has allowed the United States of America, not our adversaries, to set the price of energy. We are approaching the breaking point in our energy infrastructure. The so-called rush-to-green agenda has prevented the buildout of natural gas and other essential energy infrastructure, which is now reaching capacity. Many States, like my own State of South Carolina, are now at risk of approaching an energy deficit in the next few years if we don't immediately change our current regulatory framework. Fortunately, H.R. 1 addresses these concerns by requiring States to raise legitimate water quality concerns for interstate pipelines and LNG export facilities through FERC's NEPA process instead of weaponizing section 401 of the Clean Water Act to block pipelines. This change is critical to prevent the political agenda of States abusing section 401 to veto projects of national significance while preserving the ability of States to raise legitimate water quality concerns. New England States could finally get gas from the Marcellus shale instead of importing natural gas from Russia, Iran, Venezuela, and a lot of our other adversaries around the globe. We have the resources here not only to meet our domestic demand but also to be a leading exporter globally. Representative DeGette mentioned earlier about capacity and U.S. production and how that would limit available gas for American domestic energy production. The Progressive Policy Institute, which is far from a conservative think tank, put out an article, ``The Climate Case for Expanding U.S. Natural Gas Exports,'' which talks about using that domestically. I would ask you to read it. This package also sets a framework to export our domestic resources so our allies will no longer have to rely on Vladimir Putin's energy oligarchy. The Democrats keep calling this the polluters over people act. That couldn't be further from the truth. The reality is that their energy policies put Russia, China, OPEC+, and radical Green New Deal interests over the interests of the American people. The greatest beneficiaries of their policies are the CCP and Vladimir Putin. Green New Deal policies leave us totally dependent on China for critical minerals that make all of our devices work. Even the green energy devices, wind and solar, need those critical minerals. We have them here. We harvest them cleaner, more environmentally friendly than anywhere in the world. Let's produce them here. That is what H.R. 1 allows us to do. H.R. 1 puts the American people first by unleashing American energy and securing our supply chains. It will increase American energy production and restore American energy leadership in the world. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.",
              "I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for the great job she is doing as chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee to bring forward important bills that will increase America's national security and energy security. There is absolutely no reason that we have to be reliant on foreign countries for our energy. We have actually got the energy here in America. In fact, for those people that are concerned about carbon emissions, for all those carbon footprint warriors that got on their private jets and flew to Davos last week to lecture the rest of the world about not using fossil fuels--they didn't take commercial flights. They had to take their private charters, not with solar panels on the wings of those airplanes, using jet fuel. They lecture the whole world about getting rid of fossil fuels in America, not in other countries. You saw President Biden himself get on Air Force One and fly to Saudi and beg Saudi princes to produce more energy as he is shutting down production in America, limiting leases, limiting pipelines, killing Keystone and other pipelines, limiting the ability to get permits to do basic exploration in America. He is green-lighting pipelines in Russia, green-lighting pipelines and drilling in other places, urging and begging drilling in other places. By the way, if you are concerned about the carbon footprint, no country in the world that produces energy does it better than America. We should want to be doing more in America. As production goes up and goes down based on good or bad policies, as we are seeing today with bad policies, the Nation back in the 1970s said that we are going to have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve--in essence, an American piggy bank to protect our country in case there is some major disruption in world markets, in energy production in America. Maybe there is a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico that limits our ability to produce energy for a brief period of time. That is why we have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is not there to go mask your bad policies. Yet, that is what we have seen from this President. As you can see, this President has raided more than 40 percent of America's strategic reserve; our piggy bank. He has just taken it away. In some cases, he actually sold that oil to China. We came together last week, Republicans and Democrats. The press actually said it was going to be a partisan exercise, so why even waste the time. What they found out is not only did a Republican say it is wrong to raid our piggy bank in America and sell it to China, a majority of Democrats actually agreed with us and sent that bill to the Senate. I urge the Senate to take up that bill that is important to America's national security. But then, today we go even further and say, Mr. Speaker, with this bill, H.R. 21, if you are going to raid our reserves, won't you at least put forward a plan to show how you will replace it. Don't worry. I know the White House gets nervous when you tell them that you have got to produce energy in America. They don't have a problem, again, with foreign countries producing energy. They just don't want it made in America. They use the tagline a lot. You hear it all the time, made in America; except when it comes to making energy, they don't want to make it in America. They make it harder to make it in America. They beg foreign countries to make our energy. This bill says--gives an exemption--except in the case of a severe energy supply interruption. So the President's still got the ability, if there is some actual emergency, to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve the way it was intended in the 1970s. All this bill says is if your bad policy is leading to higher gas prices--and people are getting angry about that, as they should--you can't go and raid it unless you show a plan, as the bill says, the development of a plan to increase oil and gas production under oil and gas leases of Federal lands here. So this would make a lot of sense, except if you are at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In fact, yesterday, the President actually issued a veto threat on this bill. Now, a veto threat should be a rare exercise that you reserve for policy that might hurt the country. Well, let's read why the President issued the veto threat. In his veto threat he said, the administration's use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has been essential to protecting our energy security and to lowering gas prices for Americans. I hope I am not the one that breaks this news to the White House, but Mr. Speaker, your policies have not lowered gas prices for Americans. Maybe the calculator is broken at the White House, but we did the math. Let's do some fact-checking. Since Joe Biden took the oath of office, gas prices have not lowered; they have increased 50 percent. Then the veto threat says, we don't want to do this because our policies have lowered gas prices. Maybe the President, when he realizes that gas prices have gone up 50 percent--they have not lowered for families--he might reverse the veto threat. So we will wait during this debate. Maybe we will get a reversal of this veto threat once he realizes that gas prices have actually gone up, not a little, but a lot, 50 percent increase for a low-income family who is struggling already under the weight of President Biden's spending that has led to inflation and higher prices everywhere you go, the grocery store, supply chain increases. This is crushing middle-class families. It is crushing lower-income families. So what we say is, let's just use our resources. The President actually goes on to say--and this might be the most perplexing part of the President's veto threat; probably explains the most why the President is so misguided on energy policy. He says, because H.R. 21 will jeopardize our energy security and increase gas prices for working families, the administration strongly opposes the bill. So, somehow, some of the energy experts at the White House, again, some of the same people that fly around on private planes to Davos telling you not to use fossil fuels, they think that by increasing American energy production that will somehow raise gas prices. Well, guess what? We have checked the record. These are the same experts whose policies have increased gas prices, not a little, 50 percent. So the White House has been wrong on this issue over and over again, to the point where we had such a strong bipartisan vote last week. Let's put up another strong bipartisan vote and maybe wake the people up at the White House as to what is happening in the real world. When families who are struggling go to fill up their gas tanks, they are not paying less, as the President suggests. Again, the President actually thinks, in his veto threat, that his policies have lowered gas prices. A 50 percent increase is not a lower gas price. It is actually a kick to the gut of those families who are struggling; and we have got to stop having Washington kick them in the gut. So if you look at the moniker right above the Speaker's rostrum, there is a plaque that says, let us develop the natural resources of our land. Why don't we actually do that? Why don't we actually do what has proven to work over and over again? If we open up American energy, it is the cleanest in the world. Don't beg foreign dictators to do it. They don't do it as clean as us, by the way; and it also lowers prices. It also creates good American jobs. Let's actually make it in America again and, if you are going to raid the piggy bank, at minimum, show the country your plan for how you plan to replace it. That is the least this President should do. Let's pass this bill with a strong vote over to the Senate and then get this on the President's desk, and maybe he will reconsider and recognize just what his policies have done to hurt families over these last 2 years. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 21."

              "I thank the Chairwoman for the time. She has done a great job. We look forward to big things on the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. Speaker, I have been watching this debate, and the Democrats are having a hard time defending the administration's drawdown of a strategic asset for the political reasons to lower gas prices during an election year. I mean, it is obvious. The ranking member has been down here on the floor, pretty much left alone to debate this piece of legislation. Even the Biden administration understands that House Democrats will have to support this sound energy policy that facilitates oil and gas development and has preemptively threatened to veto this legislation. The Biden administration has said time and again that there is nothing prohibiting energy production in the United States. But we, the people, we know better because we lived it. We saw when energy production was high in this country under the past administration, gas prices were lower. Once the Biden administration came in and started stopping oil and gas leasing and drilling, gas prices went up, and they felt the political pressure. The Biden administration and the House Democrats felt the political pressure. So what did they do? They tapped into a strategic reserve for America. The SPR, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, is set aside for emergencies like Hurricane Katrina, for a time of war, for emergencies, not for a political maneuver to lower gas prices in an election year. I will tell you what: Put your money where your mouth is. Support this measure instead of hiding behind the excuse that this bill ties the President's hands, which we know isn't true. The SPR should never be tapped to offset high consumer prices caused by irresponsible energy policies. H.R. 21 calls out what we know: Draining the SPR, as it has been drained over the last 15 months, acknowledges that getting prices down is about having more supply on the market. It was a blip. It was a temporary price reduction at home. We need to produce here. We need to produce now. We have been blessed in this Nation with abundant natural resources, but we have been cursed by liberal politicians who don't want us to tap into those abundant resources. How could anyone believe this administration supports oil and gas production when President Biden literally campaigned on ending the industry? So prove us wrong. Show support for this legislation. Show America you support sound energy policy, and vote in support of H.R. 21. Take the first step in unleashing American energy production and allow America to become energy dominant once again.",
              "I thank the chairwoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 21, the Strategic Production Response Act. Instead of unleashing America's vast domestic energy resources, President Biden has hobbled our Nation's energy production, resulting in fuel shortages and rising energy costs for all American families. He went so far as begging foreign dictators for oil instead of uplifting America's economy. It is worth noting that just a few short years ago, America was energy independent. House Republicans have made it clear that we are going to hold the Biden administration accountable for its actions. As we sit here today, President Biden is draining around 40 percent of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The reserve was established to be used for national emergencies, not for cheap political points or Band- Aids for failed policies. The Strategic Production Response Act would require the Biden administration to replenish and maintain the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and this legislation would require the Secretary of Energy to come up with a plan to replenish the reserve if oil is taken for nonemergency reasons. The President has ample solutions in front of him to fix America's energy crisis. In fact, Republicans have been offering up long-term energy solutions to the Biden administration, but they refuse to listen. Instead, they have given in to the demands of left-wing special interests and radical environmental groups and have left the American people stranded. In America, we do our part in making sure that the energy we produce is done in a cleaner and safer way than any other country on Earth. Unleashing American energy is the solution to our Nation's energy crisis. My message to President Biden is simple: The days of taking shortcuts to cover up major policy failures are over. H.R. 21 is an important step in holding the administration accountable for their actions, and I am proud to support this legislation.",
              "Mr. Speaker, today's bill shows that there is no real vision for Republican energy policy. They don't have a path forward. This was their chance to engage meaningfully on energy policy, to set the tone for a new Congress, where we would work together to protect American energy interests. Instead, they are reduced to defending their oil and gas interests and attacking President Biden's successful efforts to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower gas prices for Americans. I have said it before: Republican administrations, Republican Presidents have released oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the past. I am sure that if we had a Republican President now, they would be heralding the fact that he released oil from the reserves in order to bring down gasoline prices at the pump. I want to mention, again, this letter from Secretary Granholm, our Energy Secretary. She states her Department's position on the bill. According to her, this bill would severely restrict or threaten the administration's ability to respond to emergency situations, such as the emergency supply shortage from the one triggered by the war in Ukraine. This bill would not only make it so that gas prices go higher but make it more difficult for us to address supply problems. The Secretary identifies, in my opinion, in irrefutable terms, the Biden administration's successful use of the reserve to lower gas prices for Americans. Now, understand what this bill does. It prohibits the Department of Energy from releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve until it expands oil and gas drilling on Federal lands by the same percentage that it releases oil from the reserve. The previous speaker, Mr. Soto, pointed out that the fossil fuel industry already controls large portions of U.S. public lands and waters, and it isn't using most of it. The problem is not a shortage of leases or land. The problem is a fossil fuel industry more interested in keeping supply artificially low so that prices stay artificially high. They don't want to pump oil because if they do so, then the gas price goes down. That is not what they want. They want to make greater profits. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues, please, the House Republicans are doing the bidding of their Big Oil friends at Americans' expense while threatening the President's ability to take timely actions to lower prices for American consumers at the pump. This bill is a giveaway to Republicans' fossil fuel friends, who already received billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded subsidies and enjoyed record-shattering profits last year at the expense of working families. Releasing oil from the reserve in response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine was a critical, commonsense strategy that helped lower gas prices for American families by a $1.69 per gallon since their peak. Restricting the Federal Government's best tools in the middle of a global energy crisis with no benefit other than increasing the profits of the fossil fuel industry is extreme, and I don't use that word loosely. This bill is an extreme policy that is going to make it so much more difficult for the President to act to deal with the supply chain problems and to try to lower prices for average Americans. It is extreme in the real sense. Mr. Speaker, for that reason, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 21, and I yield back the balance of my time."

              "I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 21, and I urge all my colleagues to oppose this big giveaway to Big Oil. The bill before us today is yet another effort to open our public lands and waters to major new oil and gas extraction. This is despite the fact that oil companies already control huge amounts of our public lands and waters, most of which they don't even use. Right now, oil and gas companies have about 9,000 approved but unused permits across 26 million acres of public land. Right now, offshore they have 2,000 active leases covering 12 million acres, three-quarters of which aren't being used. This bill asks us to give them even more land--an area three times the size of California, or more than 300 million additional acres. Big Oil has more public land than they can use. They could expand production today if they really wanted to. Instead, they lobby Congress to open up even more lands to extraction, to lower environmental standards, and to give them more taxpayer-funded subsidies. And in the process, they lock out public land and public access from other essential uses that would contribute to the American people and contribute to the mitigation and remediation and the climate action that is required around the issue of climate and the climate crisis. To add insult to injury, this bill would actually make it harder to help everyday Americans. It would prevent the President's ability to keep down gas prices. Last year, President Biden took decisive action, allowing releases from the reserve to lower prices at the pump. Under this bill, if the President needed to act again to keep prices low, he would first have to pay off Big Oil by opening up our public lands. This bill does not protect the American people, and it certainly doesn't protect our climate or environment. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''",
              "again, I don't know how to characterize this but to say it is extreme. The gentlewoman's amendment would provide an even bigger handout to Big Oil, trading away our precious Federal lands. Now, just so we understand, right now, there is a limitation in the underlying bill which, of course, we still oppose because the underlying bill says that the plan--in other words, I think we all know that this underlying bill says: You can't use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve unless you open up more Federal or public lands to oil and gas drillings. But it does have a cap that says the plan required shall not provide for a total increase in the percentage of Federal lands described, lease for oil and gas, in excess of 10 percent. Let me just give you an idea. In the underlying bill, it could result in over 300 million acres of Federal lands being opened up for new oil and gas drilling, an area equivalent to three times the size of California and eight times the amount of Federal lands and waters currently available for oil and gas development. But the gentlewoman from Colorado says that is not good enough. The government has to allow for another 5 percent beyond that, another 50 percent more than what I described in order for us to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Again, the fossil fuel industry already controls large portions of U.S. public lands and waters, and it isn't using most of it. Right now, the fossil fuel industry is sitting on approximately 9,000 approved but unused permits for drilling on public lands. In total, the fossil fuel industry controls over 26 million acres of U.S. onshore public lands, half of which is going unused. Offshore, the fossil fuel industry has over 2,000 active leases, covering 12 million acres of Federal water, 75 percent of which is not being used to produce oil or gas. So the gentlewoman says that she wants clean air and clean water. Well, the consequence of this would be just the opposite. We would be polluting the air and probably polluting the water as well, so it makes absolutely no sense. I mean, right now, there is nothing to stand in the way of production, which is up 1 million barrels a day under President Biden, not to mention oil and gas companies are sitting on billions of dollars. They are making huge profits. The oil and gas companies don't want to produce more oil here in the United States because that would lower the price. They are about profits. They are about raising the price of gasoline at the pump. By using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, President Biden has reduced the price at the pump. So what the gentlewoman is proposing is extreme because this even allows more public lands to be leased, or require it, that is not going to be pumped anyway because the oil companies don't want it, and at the same time, prohibit this administration from actually helping the American consumer by lowering prices. It is extreme. Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to oppose it, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment requires oil and gas companies operating on our public lands to make one simple pledge to the American people, that it won't gouge consumers at the pump. It requires the Secretary of Energy to secure that commitment before any new permit to increase production on our lands will be approved. It would help prevent some of the damage that this disastrous bill would do to our Nation's ability to address skyrocketing energy prices in the country. Frankly, the bill before us is nothing more than a shameless attempt by my Republican colleagues to help increase drilling. If this bill were titled correctly, it would be known as the big win for Big Oil act, and it would come at a huge price for the American people. As the chair of the Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee in the last Congress, I have been on the front lines to bring down gas prices in this country. I held a hearing last year with the top executives from six of the Nation's largest oil producers to have them explain why Americans were suddenly being asked to pay record-high prices at the pump and why Americans should be forced to provide their companies billions of dollars in subsidies each year when they were reporting record-high profits and hardworking families were struggling hard to fill up their cars. Despite what the supporters of this bill will tell you, not one executive at that hearing claimed that opening up Federal land for drilling would lower prices at the pump. In fact, one executive at that hearing even admitted that opening up more land to drilling in the country would do nothing to bring the cost of gasoline down. Why? Because there is nothing--and I repeat, nothing--preventing the oil industry from expanding its production tomorrow if they wanted to. They just choose not to because of profits. The oil industry currently leases 26.6 million acres of Federal lands. Less than half of that land under current lease, 12.7 acres, is currently being used for production, so there is no relationship between opening up more Federal lands for the production of oil and gas and the price that Americans pay at the pump. None. Instead of helping to bring down prices for consumers, what this bill does is it really makes it harder for future administrations to respond. It takes away the one tool that has been used effectively to help alleviate the pain consumers were suddenly feeling this past summer and the one tool we have to prevent it from happening again. It prevents the President from releasing our Nation's oil reserves on to the market during a crisis. It prevents the administration from taking the steps necessary to curb excessive price increases that can cause real harm to people, family, and businesses across this country. If Republicans were serious about helping consumers, let's do it, but let's do it explicitly. Let's include in this bill a provision that will expressly prohibit these companies from gouging consumers at the pump. My amendment requires the Secretary of Energy to secure from any oil company looking to increase production on Federal lands a commitment that it will not excessively increase its prices during periods of future disruption. It gives the oil companies what the Republicans say the industry wants, which is the ability to increase production on the public lands. So all we ask for--all we ask for--Mr. Speaker, is a simple commitment that they won't gouge consumers at the pump. Sounds like a win-win to me. I would urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment to the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Point of Order"

              "this amendment simply extends existing reporting requirements. The underlying section allows the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to accept and expend funds from non- Federal entities in order to pay for staff and information technology system development to expedite permit processing. They are authorized to accept funds in fiscal years 2023 through 2025. In the original bill text, both Secretaries are required to submit annual statements to the committees of jurisdiction explaining why one or both of the following scenarios occurs: They do not accept funds contributed; or They accept but do not expend the funds contributed. This amendment adds the requirement that both Secretaries submit a report to the committee of jurisdiction that includes, for each expenditure authorized: The amount of funds accepted, and The contributing non-Federal entity. I know most folks probably don't read these reports, and they throw them in a pile. However, for future oversight efforts, it is important for the U.S. Congress to both specifically enumerate that agencies retain this information and then require them to provide it to us so not only we can see it but the American people can see how the money is being spent and who is spending it and who is giving it. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "again, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding. I do rise in support of this amendment. H.R. 1 would allow non-Federal entities to provide money to certain Federal agencies to improve permitting efficiency. This good-governance amendment, offered by my friend from Pennsylvania, would require the Secretaries who accept this money to report on where it came from and how much was provided. I think there is some confusion about the intent of what is in H.R. 1 about speeding up permitting. Mr. Speaker, before I came to Congress, I did engineering work for over two decades. I am a professional engineer, so I worked on a lot of projects where permits were required. Fortunately, we were working with State permitting agencies, and we would hear the same argument from the State permitting agencies: We don't have enough resources and enough people to do these permits. It is going to take longer. A lot of States have programs where they allow the entity trying to attain the permit to pay money to the agency so their employees can work overtime. It is really a way to increase the resources and get more out of the resources. It is not degrading the environmental protections at all. It is just moving the process forward at a faster rate. That is what the intent of H.R. 1 is: to move permitting at a faster clip so we can build all kinds of energy; so we can build solar farms and windmills and high-voltage transmission lines; so we can build pipelines; so we can extract minerals and resources here in America. We can process those and we can manufacture things from them. This is important to making our country a leader in the world by overcoming the position we are in with China on minerals and the position we are in with Russia and OPEC. Mr. Speaker, I support the underlying principle in the bill, and I support the good-governance amendment by my friend from Pennsylvania.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer an amendment requiring permitting agencies to determine their technology needs and report them to Congress. Like many of my colleagues across the aisle, I support permitting reforms. We can agree that existing permitting programs are onerous, saddling Americans with rules and regulations that are challenging at best to navigate. Unfortunately, both parties share some of the blame for creating this mess. It is Congress that has spent decades under-resourcing permitting agencies, a big cause of the backlog we are seeing today. Congress' infrastructure investments of the last few years are critical for my district and the entire country. Simply funding projects is not enough, though. That is not the goal of recent legislation. Getting projects built is the goal. Whether it is bridges, broadband, ports, or power lines, making sure that permits are being issued in a consistent and timely manner is key to any project's success. I want to make clear that ensuring predictability is an important piece of the permitting puzzle, one often left out of the discussion. When someone is applying for permits, potential approval or disapproval shouldn't be at the whims of whoever is reviewing their application. Using new technology to improve consistency can help provide the certainty that businesses crave to pursue critical projects in the first place. These reforms can't continue to help big businesses beat out our small businesses. The endless red tape involved in getting permits is a major burden for small businesses. In sector after sector of our economy, market consolidation is squeezing America's small businesses and harming consumers. A business of five employees should be on a level playing field with a business of 5,000 employees when it comes to navigating the permitting system. Ensuring that predictability is one way permitting programs can work better for small businesses. Right now we don't even know what resources permitting agencies need, and that is why the provision in H.R. 1 that agencies assess their staffing needs and report them to Congress is so important. My amendment simply extends that requirement to cover technology, as well. Technology, we all know, is changing so fast right now, and giving permitting agencies better tools can help on so many fronts. New software, including programs using machine learning, can better coordinate simultaneous application reviews by agencies, it can improve agencies' communication with applicants so they can know where their permits are in the process and any additional material that may be needed for certification. New technology can improve predictability and timely review. This is a straightforward measure that would help make the government work the way it ought to. Congress needs to make sure that permitting agencies have the staff, technology, and resources to issue permits and expand permitting capacity. I am proud to offer this amendment to ensure agencies' technology needs are met, and I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "this important amendment simply builds off existing bipartisan efforts to sensibly streamline environmental reviews by applying one Federal decision to certain pipeline projects as my friend from Louisiana indicated. At a time when our domestic energy independence is suffering and energy prices are increasing, we must look for ways to support our energy safety, infrastructure, and production. This amendment represents one way of doing that. It does not remove or alter environmental protections, rather it merely streamlines the process and consolidates essential government agencies and decisionmaking under one Federal decision. To reiterate what Mr. Graves said, it really defies explanation that my friend from the other side would oppose this, given the fact that he just voted for it in the Infrastructure Investment Act. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this amendment and the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "Mr. Speaker, this amendment is intended to further bipartisan efforts to streamline the environmental permitting process by applying one Federal decision to certain pipeline safety actions. Agencies such as the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration can be required to undertake lengthy and burdensome Federal environmental reviews that can take several months, and often times, even years to complete. As a result, essential safety and energy actions are stalled or sometimes completely stopped, which can limit our energy resources, limit our ability to be energy independent, and unnecessarily create scarcities, higher prices, and threats to the safety and health of our citizens. This amendment represents just another step toward eliminating these problems. It sets reasonable goals for reviewing the environmental impacts of certain pipeline safety actions. Specifically, it limits the review time to 2 years, consolidates Federal reviews into one streamlined process and document, and removes unnecessary delays in making final agency decisions. This amendment builds on bipartisan support and precedent for requiring agencies to undertake one Federal decision when reviewing the potential environmental impacts of the Federal action. Similar efforts have been signed into law, including for Federal reviews of highway projects as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed by President Biden in 2021. It is recognized that through one Federal decision, we can sensibly streamline energy and energy safety projects, including pipelines, without compromising environmental protections. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of my amendment and the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I rise in favor of my amendment which inserts my 90-Day Review Act into H.R. 1. My amendment will further improve H.R. 1's overall goal of ensuring reasonable timelines and predictability for projects by shortening the timeline to file a petition for judicial review of a permit, license, or approval of a major infrastructure project from 150 days to 90 days. Frivolous litigation should not be a hurdle to critical infrastructure projects that will improve the lives of Americans across the country. For far too long, we have put trial lawyers' interests ahead of the American people. Burdensome litigation causes our hardworking men and women to sit idle on job sites as they wait on court processes. It is far past time that Congress reduces the Federal Government's stranglehold on critical infrastructure projects and helps job creators put the American people to work. By streamlining the Federal litigation timeline, my amendment will help reduce frivolous litigation, cut red tape, and help critical infrastructure projects move forward in a more timely manner. My amendment will reduce the amount of time it takes to construct real and important infrastructure projects like highways, bridges, railways, dams, and other important projects that will improve the lives of the people in my district and all across America. Last Congress, we saw Democrats ram through a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill where only 9 percent of it actually went to infrastructure. Rather than focusing on meaningful reforms, this bill funded a slush fund at the Department of Energy for Green New Deal projects; tens of billions of dollars to subsidize the electric vehicle industry, establish programs to cool down pavement, reduce idling done by trucks, and even study racist roads and bridges. Yes, Mr. Speaker, you heard that correctly. Instead of spending time on this unpopular, America last agenda, House Republicans have proposed real reforms like this one, and it would cut red tape and speed up construction. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment as well as the underlying bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "Amendment No. 30 expresses the sense of Congress that the royalty rate for onshore Federal oil and gas leases be 12\\1/2\\ percent. This amendment establishes that it is the sense of Congress that the royalty rate of onshore Federal oil and gas leases be 12\\1/2\\ percent, the pre-Inflation Reduction Act level. The so-called Inflation Reduction Act was filled with horrific policy and has only made things worse. The Inflation Reduction Act is geared to severely harm American energy independence by, among other things, increasing royalty rates and fees while restricting access to energy resources. Our country needs to produce more energy, not less, but Democrats designed their extreme climate agenda to restrict oil and natural gas production. One measure of the so-called Inflation Reduction Act enabled the Biden administration to raise the oil and gas royalty rate for certain offshore leases from the current 12\\1/2\\ percent to 16.67. This measure will only result in less oil and gas production, harming consumers and our national security. The Biden administration doesn't even pretend otherwise. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said, It resets how and what we consider to be the highest and best use of American resources. This is about the use of the land, and the Biden administration clearly wants to block all of our lands from the use for oil and gas production. My amendment simply returns onshore royalty rates to what it was 2 years ago, before this radical Democrat intervention. This amendment would affirm the intent of the underlying bill, which would reset the royalty rate for onshore leases to 12\\1/2\\ percent. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "my amendment would prohibit any new leases under this plan that do not provide a fair return for taxpayers. For far too long, our oil and gas leasing program has offered a sweetheart deal for the industry at the expense of taxpayers. One fossil fuel company recently even went so far as to outline in a press release the many benefits of extraction on public land compared to private land. Their release highlighted that leases on public lands are cheaper, they last longer, and they are more expansive. While these statements may be music to the ears of those who care most about Big Oil special interests, they represent a raw deal for the American people. Increasing the royalty rate to a fair level will generate billions of dollars in revenue for taxpayers. The Government Accountability Office and Congressional Budget Office both agree and have suggested that this is good policy. That is why last Congress I introduced the Restoring Community Input and Public Protections in Oil and Gas Leasing Act, to protect taxpayers by eliminating noncompetitive oil and gas leasing and raising the onshore oil and gas royalty rate, rental fee, and minimum bid amount. I am proud that the Inflation Reduction Act includes significant provisions of that bill, including eliminating noncompetitive leasing for oil and gas sales, raising annual rental rates, and increasing the minimum bid for public lands. These provisions will go a long way in ensuring the American people see a more fair return on the use of our cherished public lands. But we have more work to do to provide a fair return. States like Texas and Oklahoma charge higher royalty rates on their State lands than are charged on Federal public lands, leading to lost revenue for Federal taxpayers. This amendment builds on those provisions and will help end giveaways of our public lands to fossil fuel companies and ensure that taxpayers receive a fair return on any private profit that oil and gas companies extract from our public lands. The American people deserve to see a fair financial return on the profits that fossil fuel companies make from their use of our cherished public lands, and this amendment will require that these companies provide that return instead of simply ripping the public off. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "my first amendment will strike title V of division B of this bill. Throughout this debate, I have heard my friends across the aisle argue that the bill before us today is a reasonable attempt to reform our permitting system. Unfortunately, this bill closely resembles a wish list for Big Oil and their lobbyists. This amendment would strike one of the most egregious portions of the bill that would undo many of the reforms we made last Congress to ensure that the American people see a better return on our public lands and waters. We should all be able to agree that the American people deserve a fair deal when it comes to the use of our cherished public lands. For far too long, our oil and gas leasing program has offered a sweetheart deal for the fossil fuel industry at the expense of taxpayers. One fossil fuel company even went so far as to outline in a press release the many benefits of extraction on public land compared to private land. Their release highlighted that leases on public lands are cheaper, last longer, and are more expansive. While these statements may be music to the ears of those who care most about Big Oil interests, they represent a raw and an unfair deal for the American people. Increasing the royalty rate to a fair level--that is all we are asking, a fair level--will generate billions of dollars in revenue for taxpayers. The Government Accountability Office and Congressional Budget Office both agree and have suggested that it is good policy. That is why, last Congress, I introduced the Restoring Community Input and Public Protections in Oil and Gas Leasing Act to protect taxpayers by eliminating noncompetitive oil and gas leasing and raising the onshore oil and gas royalty rate, rental fee, and minimum bid amount. I am proud that the Inflation Reduction Act includes significant provisions of that bill, including eliminating noncompetitive leasing for oil and gas sales, raising annual rental rates, and increasing the minimum bid for public lands. These commonsense reforms were simply long-overdue fixes to create more balanced fiscal terms and bring Federal lands in line with what States and private landowners already charge. Before the IRA, the fiscal terms for public lands leasing and drilling were, in some cases, over 100 years old. For decades, these outdated rates and fees allowed oil CEOs to lease public lands for pennies on the dollar and unfairly increase their profits at the expense of taxpayers. Even after the IRA, States like Texas and Oklahoma still charge higher royalty rates on their State lands than are charged on Federal public lands. According to Taxpayers for Common Sense, these updated fiscal terms included in the IRA will not raise prices at the pump or consumer energy prices, but they will raise billions of dollars in additional revenue that could go toward our funding education, healthcare, and infrastructure improvements that benefit everyone, not just oil and gas companies. Unfortunately, the bill before us today would also reinstate noncompetitive leasing, an indefensible practice. The Government Accountability Office also found that 99 percent of noncompetitive leases issued between 2003 and 2009 never produced oil and gas during their 10-year lease terms. The reason why these lands were not put into production is that they are leased in areas where there is virtually no likelihood of development. At its core, noncompetitive leasing is a wasteful practice that forces the Bureau of Land Management to expend limited public agency time and resources administering leases that hardly ever generate returns for taxpayers. It encourages oil and gas companies to buy up lands they will never use to pad their portfolios and appease shareholders, contributing to the 12.3 million acres of leased public lands that these companies are currently sitting on and not using. Instead of maintaining these commonsense reforms and protecting the interests of American taxpayers, title V of the bill before us today would undo all of these reforms and provide a gift to oil and gas interests. By rolling back these reforms, the majority is proposing policies that would only pad Big Oil's pocketbooks even further and increase our Federal deficit by $160 million over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, even as companies like ExxonMobil and Shell are announcing record profits. By striking this title, we can put these dollars back in the pockets of the American people and protect commonsense reforms that are finally ensuring that Federal taxpayers receive a fair return on any private profit that oil and gas companies extract from our public lands. I urge my colleagues to stand up for the American people and stand against our increasing national debt by supporting this amendment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "this amendment seeks to help provide a voice for local communities who were ignored and cut out of the process in October of last year when the Biden administration unilaterally locked up nearly 300,000 acres in Colorado and in my district through the stroke of a pen. Shamefully, the Biden administration ignored the concerns and opposition of impacted communities so he could appease Green New Deal extremists through this executive overreach. After the proposed land grab was announced, Kathleen Sgamma, president of Western Energy Alliance, stated: ``The White House has initiated a withdrawal for the Thompson Divide while advancing a false narrative that energy development and land protection are mutually exclusive. ``Oil and natural gas activity has taken place in the Thompson Divide area since the 1940s while conserving the land. We can do both: We can develop energy while protecting the land.'' The area remains a vital resource and is located within the second largest potential natural gas reserve in the United States. ``There's no need to lock away public lands and minerals, especially at a time of high energy prices.'' With gas prices skyrocketing again, and today's national average exceeding $3.50 per gallon, it makes even less sense to unilaterally lock up hundreds of thousands of acres from responsible energy production, especially while local stakeholders are ignored and are flatout opposed. After the mineral withdrawal and associated national monument were announced in October, the Ute Indian Tribe of Utah said: ``The White House moved forward with a monument on our homelands without including us. They talk about Tribal consultation, but their actions do not match their words. We cannot support a monument on our homelands that does not include the Tribe. It is a disgrace to our ancestors to exclude the Tribe in the care and protection of these burial sites.'' Garfield County Commissioner Tom Jankovsky sent me an email just this morning stating, ``President Biden unilaterally acted with an end run around Congress. Rather than honoring the 10-year, hard-fought, bipartisan support forged by local interests with Garfield County, the President placed additional restrictions on future leasing in Thompson Divide. This gutted the original bipartisan local support.'' My amendment requires the Secretary, as part of the plan required by this bill, to identify areas for potential responsible energy leasing within the second largest potential natural gas reserve in the United States in an area where responsible oil and gas production has taken place since the 1940s. America produces the cleanest energy in the world. In fact, our natural gas is 42 percent cleaner than Russian gas. American innovation, in particular, fracking, has allowed America to be the global leader in reducing emissions since 2000. America should have never been dependent on Russia for significant quantities of oil and gas. We need to stop begging OPEC, Venezuela, and even Iran, to produce energy for us, and start producing more energy responsibly right here in America, where our guys do it better than anyone else, more responsibly, and cleaner. We have to develop this right here at home, get back to American energy independence, and pursue energy dominance. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "once again, this amendment would further allow the President to abuse the SPR by draining it without declaring a national emergency under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, giving him the ability to once again use the SPR for political purposes, and that is wrong. It is set aside for national emergencies, true national emergencies. Hurricanes hit the coast. We just saw one in Florida this year. We all remember Hurricane Katrina. We have adversaries threatening us around the world. We need the SPR full. We don't need it to be released to influence an election. We need it there for national emergencies. This amendment would further allow the President to abuse it. The statute is clear, and emergency triggers to use the SPR are very well defined. The law requires the President to declare that a ``severe energy supply interruption'' exists. The only reason a severe supply interruption exists is because of their policies, the policies of the Biden administration that took oil and gas production in this Nation off the table. We have American resources here. We are blessed in this Nation with abundant natural resources, but we are cursed by liberal politicians who don't want America to be energy independent. They don't want us to be energy dominant. They want to take those resources off the table for production to increase supply to meet demand to lower prices for consumers, manufacturers, and people across America. The statute defines a supply interruption as follows: ``An emergency situation exists and there is a significant reduction in supply which is of significant scope and duration.'' There was no emergency situation existing when the President withdrew oil from the SPR. ``A severe increase in the price of petroleum products has resulted from such emergency situation.'' Where was the emergency? Yes, we had higher prices because supply was low due to the policies of the administration that took oil and gas production off the table. He created the emergency if you want to call it an emergency. Number three: ``Such price increase is likely to or may cause a major adverse impact on the national economy.'' There is a solution. Drill here. Drill now. Produce American energy. The SPR is a critical national security asset. We have said that over and over and over and over and over on this side. It is a national asset paid for by the taxpayers, set aside for the use of this Nation in time of a real emergency. A real emergency. The SPR is a critical national security asset. It should have only been utilized in accordance with the law. This amendment would affect that. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment is simple and straightforward. My amendment provides congressional disapproval of the denial of the Jordan Cove project permits. The Jordan Cove project was an important liquefied natural gas proposal that would have been the only West Coast LNG export terminal and would have been essential to exporting LNG to our allies in the Pacific and freedom around the world. The Department of Energy determined that the Jordan Cove project was expected to create 6,000 jobs during peak construction and generate up to $100 million in State and local tax revenue annually. Importantly, this project would have allowed us to export clean liquefied natural gas to our allies, many of which have been dependent on energy from Russia, OPEC, Venezuela, and even Iran. America makes the cleanest energy around the world. In fact, our natural gas is 42 percent cleaner than Russian gas. American innovation, in particular, fracking, has allowed America to be the global leader in emissions since 2000. In 2016, the United States Geological Survey released a report that increased the estimate of technically recoverable natural gas in the Mancos shale deposit from 1.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to a staggering 66.3 trillion, a 40-fold increase. David Ludlam, who worked for the West Slope Colorado Oil and Gas Association, said, there is enough natural gas to power the State of California for 50 years right in Colorado's Third District's backyard, and the need for our community to join the global energy marketplace has never been more urgent. A West Coast LNG export terminal would have shaved critical days and significant costs off exports to Asia, eliminated threats associated with hurricanes, and reduced our reliance on the Panama Canal, which causes significant uncertainty and delays. We should be advancing energy infrastructure projects to help ensure American energy dominance and help promote economic growth through a true all-of-the-above energy policy, not having elected politicians and bureaucrats pick winners and losers in the energy sector. Importantly, Jordan Cove has significant bipartisan support. In fact, the project in Colorado was supported by former-U.S. Senator Cory Gardner, U.S. Senator Michael Bennet, former-Governor John Hickenlooper, the Colorado Senate, the liberal Denver Post, the liberal Grand Junction Daily Sentinel, and local governments in western Colorado, including Mesa, Garfield, Rio Blanco, Moffat, Routt, Delta, and many other counties and municipalities in my region. While similar project proposals have languished for decades, Jordan Cove was on track for success after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted two Federal permits for the Jordan Cove Energy Project and issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity to the Pacific Connector Gas Pipeline in March of 2019. Unfortunately, the anti-pipeline, anti-natural gas, liberal Governor's administration in Oregon denied the permits and the certificate necessary for these projects, essentially killing the project in December of 2021 when the company pulled out, citing their inability to obtain the necessary State permits in the immediate future. If Green New Deal extremists in the Governor's office actually cared about the environment, they would have supported this project as natural gas emissions result in significantly fewer air pollutants and carbon dioxide emissions, and this important project would have advanced local, regional, and global emissions reduction goals. Like the Keystone XL pipeline, Jordan Cove was a major opportunity killed by extreme environmentalists whose sole agenda isn't protecting the environment, isn't being good stewards of what we have been blessed with, but is keeping our American energy sources in the ground and killing off fossil fuels. America deserves an American energy strategy that works for all Americans, and this amendment makes clear that we should not allow States with a misguided agenda to kill projects of national and global energy importance. Mr. Speaker, I support adoption of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time."

              "once again, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment, which would unnecessarily waive fundamental environmental laws for wildfire mitigation activity adjacent to roads. Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill we are considering today is a polluter wish list of environmental shortcuts designed to open our public lands to more and more extraction while cutting the public out of the decisionmaking process. The bottom line is, I simply do not think that Congress should be in the business of waiving requirements outlined in the Endangered Species Act or the National Environmental Protection Act. These laws provide critical protections that guide the management of our public lands and waters--critical protections that do not hinder efforts to mitigate wildfire risk or manage our forests. In fact, many of the activities contemplated by the amendment are covered under existing categorical exclusions, which allow land management agencies to carry out routine projects in a fast, efficient, and flexible manner. I will not deny that carrying out wildfire mitigation projects across our national forest and public land is a critical priority. However, we do not have to cast aside environmental standards to get it done. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I thank our chairman for his diligent work on H.R. 1 and the amendments that are going with it. I appreciate it. Mr. Speaker, I rise today not only to support H.R. 1, that will make long overdue changes to our permitting system and allow time-sensitive projects to be considered and approved in a reasonable timeframe, but I am also in support of two amendments that I am very pleased to see included. The first amendment is No. 23, otherwise known as the Combustion Avoidance along Rural Roads Act, or the CARR Act. The CARR Act is named after the 2018 devastating wildfire that occurred in Redding, California, that started from a flat trailer tire igniting roadside vegetation. This fire coined the term ``firenado'' as it occurred there with the deadly winds that whipped that fire into what became a 230,000-acre blaze that also took eight lives. This bill would waive time-consuming requirements under NEPA and the ESA for wildfire mitigation activities conducted within 300 feet of a roadway. These wildfire mitigation activities would include thinning, hazardous fuels reduction, prescribed burning, and vegetation management, and be overseen by the Department of the Interior or USDA, and be conducted on Federal land as administered by the National Park system, the Bureau of Land Management, or the Forest Service. Roadways, of course, can be a higher risk area for combustion. It only makes sense to do the type of thinning and management along roadways to vastly reduce that risk. Had this been in practice already, the Carr fire likely would not have happened. I hope we can have this kind of common sense be applied toward our roadsides under the CARR Act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "amendment No. 24, also known also the CLEAR Zones Act, is an enhancement of the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act. This amendment would extend the hazard zone around power lines to allow utility companies to clear trees that pose a danger to transmission infrastructure. It also gives automatic approval of vegetation management plans after 60 days, which keeps these plans moving forward while still giving adequate time for reasonable review instead of needless delays in these critical fire risk zones. During debate, I have heard some of my colleagues refer to this amendment and other proposals in H.R. 1 as a giveaway, in this case, to utility companies, or a trashing of the environment. That is offensively untrue. Indeed, the environment suffers much more by the massive amount of fire we are talking about. Both of my amendments are a direct response to wildfires that have already occurred in my district. Had they been in place, largely, the Camp fire that destroyed the town of Paradise, 153,000 acres and took 85 lives, would not have happened, as a fire caught from foliage that was underneath a power line. Also, the million-acre Dixie fire that occurred in my district from what looked like a healthy tree falling into a power line, destroyed two towns additionally, Greenville and Canyondam. I was there at Canyondam 5 minutes before it was lost completely. Unlike most environmental regulations, this policy is not just about potential future effects, it is also about the fires that have already happened. They have already destroyed homes, already taken lives. This is a message to those folks that your suffering was not needless. It is about stopping these wildfires from happening again by having wise management around our power lines so that the odds of fire occurring from these power lines existing in our rural areas is reduced greatly. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

              "I rise today to put on the Record my opposition to H.R. 1, the polluters over people act, for the many unnecessary and unhelpful provisions that would jeopardize the health and well-being of Ohio's 13th Congressional District and communities across this great Nation. I find it hard to believe that the bill designated as H.R. 1, the priority bill that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are uplifting, would increase the national deficit all while endangering our communities by creating unsafe drinking water. That is the priority, increasing the national debt and making us less safe. Everyone here agrees that we must ensure that the Federal Government is approving domestic energy projects safely and quickly, and we can all agree that the current permitting process leaves much to be desired. However, this process should not come at the expense of the communities who simply want clean drinking water. I have been in Congress, Mr. Speaker, for about 3 months, and this is at least the second time this body has rejected clean water. All of this in the backdrop of a train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, just about 40 miles from my district. We know pollution knows no boundaries, particularly no congressional boundaries. Whether it is East Palestine or Portage County where I represent, I simply cannot stand silent as polluters attempt to poison our water. Further, Mr. Speaker, I have listened to accusations of activist Governors who would weaponize provisions of the Clean Water Act. For that reason, States like mine, Ohio, with a Republican Governor, Republican statewide leaders, and a Republican supermajority in the legislature should not decide how to protect the people of our State. Again, I am shocked about the total disregard of the people of Ohio simply to protect polluters. Mr. Speaker, my community elected me to find bipartisan solutions, not pollute their water or pursue partisan politics, and that is why I offered an amendment that would allow States to decide what they thought was best for their community, and particularly in a State like Ohio where there is a train derailment that has jeopardized the water quality and safety in Ohio. However, that amendment was rejected. There is nothing partisan about wanting to make sure our children and our neighbors can drink a glass of water without worrying if chemicals like vinyl chloride are also being consumed. Time and time and time again, my colleagues are promoting and protecting polluters at the expense of our people, and I simply refuse to vote for this bill.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, which will unlock United States energy potential, benefiting Missourians and Americans nationwide. Broadly speaking, this bill is important for so many reasons, from increasing domestic energy production to encouraging the production of critical minerals to modernizing the NEPA process for energy and other infrastructure projects. This bill does exactly what the title says. Division C of the bill was produced by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and it focuses on streamlining and clarifying the scope of section 401 of the Clean Water Act to prevent its continued abuse in blocking energy infrastructure projects. Many projects that require water quality certifications under section 401 are critical to our Nation's energy production, such as natural gas pipelines, LNG, and coal export terminals. Division C of the bill makes clear that States cannot block important energy projects on grounds outside of the Clean Water Act quality standards, consistent with the intent of the original law. Last month, H.R. 1152, which is encompassed within division C, was marked up and passed out of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. As included in H.R. 1, division C is incredibly important to lowering energy costs and boosting energy production while still ensuring water quality. Mr. Speaker, I thank two of my subcommittee chairmen, David Rouzer and Garret Graves, for their leadership in sponsoring this piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I would urge support of the bill. By passing H.R. 1, the House would support moving critical energy projects forward and support lowering costs for Americans through greater energy independence. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1, particularly division C, which was introduced in the House as H.R. 1152, and was marked up by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure with strong opposition from my Democratic colleagues. The polluters over the people act let polluters off the hook for harmful actions and damaging impacts to our rivers, lakes, and our streams that our local communities rely on for clean, safe drinking water. Division C is an attack on section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which is a key mechanism for States and Tribes to evaluate projects that cross within their borders and have an impact on their waters and environment for decades. Section 401 has been a successful example of cooperative federalism, while preserving State authority to manage their natural resources. Section 401 has been a well-supported, effective tool since the beginning of the Clean Water Act, but the Trump administration found a way to make it a scapegoat for the failure of senseless and harmfully polluting mega-projects. The provisions in the polluters over people act will tie the hands of States and Tribes seeking to preserve stream flow for their water supplies, to prevent runoff and water pollution, and to minimize impacts to flood-preventing wetlands. It goes against the Clean Water Act's rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution. First, in California, this bill would have huge impacts. For one, limiting analysis to only discharges would mean the State would be unable to consider the impact of the whole project, such as increasing impervious surfaces, or considering downstream effects. Our State is trying to preserve every drop of water we can get. Yet, this bill would stop my State from protecting its water supply from the adverse impacts of projects pursued by out-of-State interests. Second, this bill places arbitrary, and likely impossible timelines on the States to act on permit requests. Despite how complicated or huge the project might be, this bill will severely limit the time allowed for a State to review its impact. My friends across the aisle may not realize this, but this bill may lead to greater numbers of project rejections as the State is pressured to respond without the time to fully analyze the project. This bill is another attempt to gut--really gut--the Clean Water Act and allow pollution and industry to act without repercussion. We must defend human health, our economy, and the natural environment, and oppose the damaging bill that will harm local communities. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the State of California, State of Washington, and the State of New York in strong opposition to H.R. 1152, which is the bill that became division C, H.R. 1. February 28, 2023. Hon. Chairman Graves, Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Graves: As the water quality certifying agencies for California, New York, and Washington, we write to underscore the importance of existing law in protecting state waters from water pollution associated with federally licensed projects. On February 24, 2023, Representatives Rouzer and Graves introduced H.R. 1152--Water Quality Certification and Energy Project Improvement Act of 2023, to amend section 401 of the Clean Water Act that would, among other things, revise section 401 to: (1) reduce the scope of states' and tribes' 401 water quality certification authority to apply only to the discharge to a water of the United States, rather than the whole of the activity; (2) narrow states' and tribes' section 401 water quality certification authority to exclude much of what is required to comply with water quality standards and implementation plans under section 303 of the Clean Water Act; (3) remove the states' and tribes' authority to ensure compliance with ``other appropriate requirement[s] of State law''; (4) replace references to an ``application'' for certification with a ``request'' for certification; and (5) impose a time requirement on states and tribes to identify information needed before taking an action on a certification request, (6) make other changes to the law that introduce substantial uncertainty about the scope of section 401 for project proponents and state and tribes. Each of these changes would undermine states' abilities to protect water quality within their states and erode five decades of successful, cooperative federalism. We ask that Congress preserve the existing state authority in the Clean Water Act to substantively review a project's effects on water quality before a federal permit or license is issued. Background Under section 401 of the Clean Water Act, a federal agency may not issue a permit or license to conduct any activity that may result in any discharge into waters of the United States unless a section 401 water quality certification is issued, or certification is waived. The State Water Resources Control Board (``State Water Board'') and the nine California Regional Water Quality Control Boards (collectively, ``Water Boards''), [NY Signatory], [WA Signatory] are certifying agencies pursuant to section 401 of the Clean Water Act. In all three states, the most common federal licenses subject to section 401 are Clean Water Act section 404 dredge or fill permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and licenses for hydropower facilities issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. During the five decades since Congress enacted section 401 in the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970, state water quality agencies diligently processed thousands of section 401 requests each year with little controversy. The vast majority of section 401 certifications were issued promptly and most section 401 certifications were granted, with only a handful of denials issued each year. Beginning around 2016, prompted by a handful of high-profile section 401 denials, some project applicants and industry lobbyists began claiming that states were ``abusing'' their section 401 authority. Such claims of abuse are not, and never have been, true. In the handful of cases when project applicants have alleged improper certification decisions or delay by state agencies, they have been fully capable of protecting their rights under section 401 through the traditional framework of administrative and judicial review. Section 401 is a cornerstone of the cooperative federalism principles enshrined by the Clean Water Act Cooperative federalism is a foundational component of the Clean Water Act. As set forth in Clean Water Act section 101 (b), ``[i]t is the policy of the Congress to recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution'' and ``to plan the development and use . . . of land and water resources.'' Section 510 further specifies that except as expressly provided, nothing in the Clean Water Act shall preclude or deny the right of any State to adopt or enforce any standard or limitation respecting discharges of pollutants or any requirement respecting control or abatement of pollution. The section 401 certification program is an embodiment of these cooperative federalism principles. A state certification is the mechanism of ensuring that a federal license or permit is not used as an excuse to violate state or federal water quality standards. As currently written, the language in section 401 acknowledges that states are in the best position to understand their own laws and that additional conditions may be necessary to ensure compliance with state law and applicable Clean Water Act requirements. As the federal permitting or licensing agency is often not an agency primarily tasked with managing environmental issues, the federal agency may in fact be reliant on the certification authority's expertise regarding water quality. To prevent a section 401 certification from becoming a rubber stamp, any revision to the section 401 language must preserve an expansive view of the cooperative federalism principles originally envisioned by the Clean Water Act and repeatedly affirmed by the Supreme Court. PUD No. 1 of Jefferson Cnty. v. Washington Dep't of Ecology, 511 U.S. 700 (1994); S.D. Warren Co. v. Maine Bd. of Env't Prot., 547 U.S. 370 (2006). The Clean Water Act should continue to protect the whole range of water quality effects resulting from the proposed activity We strongly support the existing statutory language, which gives states and tribes the authority to regulate the potentially water-polluting activity as a whole, rather than being limited to a strict interpretation of effects from only the discharge, because regulation of the activity as a whole protects waters from the widest range of impacts. States should be able to protect water quality regardless of whether the pollution or other water quality impacts would be specifically attributable to a discharge or from some other aspect of the activity being permitted. States should be able to use the certification process to address impacts to groundwater, impacts to isolated surface waters, or impacts from non-point sources, all of which are likely not directly attributable to the discharge to a water of the United States, because these are water quality impacts that would not occur without issuance of the federal permit or license. The problems with limiting certifications to the discharge rather than the whole of the activity would be particularly impactful on the states' ability to protect water quality during the decades long term of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``FERC'') licenses in the hydropower licensing context. States and tribes must be able to fully address the water quality impacts of such activities as a whole during the 30- to 50-year term of the FERC license to reduce water quality impacts that, depending on the circumstances, may not be attributable to a point-source discharge, but result from the activity's construction, operations, and facilities. Common water quality impacts associated with hydropower activities include changes in turbidity, sediment, siltation, temperature, habitat loss, alterations to stream geomorphology, dissolved oxygen, algal productivity and algal-produced toxins, erosion, barriers to fish passage, alterations to stream geomorphology, and reductions in stream flow. Each of these impacts can have profound, generational impacts on the state's water resources. To prevent or minimize these potential impacts, states have imposed, or considered the need for certification conditions to protect water quality on project activities that fall outside the typical understanding of point-source discharges, such as requirements for minimum instream flows and ramping rates; temperature management; aquatic invasive species management; plans for gravel replenishment, large woody material placement and other habitat measures; reservoir operation plans; erosion and sediment management plans; and monitoring and management of dissolved oxygen, mercury, pesticides, and other constituents of concerns. Previously issued certifications have typically included management, monitoring, and reporting measures to ensure compliance with water quality measures and to identify potential modifications if circumstances change. Revising the statutory language to contradict longstanding interpretations would introduce confusion and invite arguments about the nexus between the discharge and the impact, when a state or tribe's focus should more appropriately be on all water quality impacts resulting from the project. Introducing the concept of whether the activity will ``directly result'' in a discharge in subsection (a)(1) and (a)(4) would inject additional uncertainty and potentially further limit the certifying authority's ability to protect water quality. Although the states would rely on their state authority to continue to preserve robust protection of water quality whenever possible, state authority would not be an available remedy where state law is preempted by federal law. Because the Federal Power Act preempts the field of hydropower regulation absent an express exception to preemption, and FERC project licenses are valid for a fixed period of up to 50 years, water quality certifications for FERC license applications provide the states with a singular opportunity to ensure compliance with the state's water quality standards and other requirements. If the states' ability to regulate FERC licensed projects to the same extent that it has been able to for decades is significantly weakened, other, non- FERC projects would be subject to more stringent requirements to compensate for the failure of FERC-licensed projects to contribute what would otherwise be their allocated responsibility. The Clean Water Act should continue to authorize certifications to implement water quality standards and implementation plans adopted or approved under section 303 of the Clean Water Act Under section 401 of the Clean Water Act a water quality certification implements the applicable provisions of sections 301, 302, 303, 306 and 307 of the Clean Water Act and any other appropriate requirement of state law. The most important of the enumerated provisions of the Clean Water Act is section 303, which provides for water quality standards and implementation plans. Section 303 requires development and approval of water quality standards, which consist of designated uses, criteria, and anti-degradation policies; establishment of total maximum daily loads, which allocate responsibility for meeting standards that cannot be met solely through compliance with the technology-based requirements of the Clean Water Act; and implementation of a continuing planning process. In 1994, the Supreme Court upheld state authority to set conditions of certification to protect uses designated as part of the water quality standards under section 303. PUD No. 1, 511 U.S. at 700. The Court rejected an argument that certification is limited to implementing the criteria component of those standards. Consistent with the Supreme Court's ruling, states have made effective use water quality certification authority to protect water quality needed for commercial, tribal, and recreational fisheries and other important uses of state waters. The proposed revision to limit ``applicable provisions'' of section 303 to ``requirement of state law implementing water quality criteria under section 303 necessary to support the designated use or uses of the receiving navigable waters'' could strip the states' authority to use their certification authority to protect the uses of waters of the United States designated as part of water quality standards under section 303. By inexplicably omitting any reference to federal requirements that implement section 303, it would also create substantial uncertainty about states' and tribes' ability to enforce water quality criteria, total maximum daily loads, and antidegradation requirements adopted by U.S. EPA. Congress should not remove the states' authority to require compliance with state water quality requirements We strongly oppose the bill's proposed revisions that would limit the certifying authority to ensuring compliance with only specific sections of the Clean Water Act by deleting the existing reference to ``any other appropriate requirement of State law'' set forth in section 401 subsection (d). Such a revision would disregard a state's right to impose more stringent water quality requirements and be contrary to the protective goals of the Clean Water Act. As is accounted for and endorsed by the Clean Water Act, many states have state-based programs and attendant requirements that arguably or explicitly expand beyond the state's Clean Water Act authorities. The Clean Water Act expressly contemplated a state's authority to establish and enforce more stringent state requirements beyond the Clean Water Act. For example, certifications may include monitoring and reporting requirements that arguably go beyond ensuring compliance with specific sections of the Clean Water Act, and instead help determine whether water quality is being degraded or to shape the development of future actions to protect water quality. We urge Congress to refrain from making an unwarranted intrusion into a state's authority to impose stricter conditions to protect the quality of waters within its borders. Section 401 should preserve the certifying authority's ability to define the contents of a request for certification and create submission procedures The bill proposes revising references to ``application'' to be ``request.'' Although the intention behind that revision is not clear, we support language that recognizes that the certifying authority may define the contents of a request for certification and create submission procedures. The state's ability to define what is required for a request for certification is significant because a receipt of such a request is the trigger for the beginning of the reasonable period of time for a certifying authority to act on the request. The bill proposes an addition requiring certifying authorities to ``publish requirements for certification,'' but it is not clear whether this language is an indirect reference to a certifying authority's ability to define required information for applications and submittal procedures. To the extent that ``requirements'' were intended to require the enactment of new state regulations, 30 days is insufficient time to comply with public notice and comment requirements for State Water Board adoption. Section 401 should not impose an arbitrary time limit on the certifying authority's ability to request information The bill proposes revisions to subsection (a)(1) that specify that by 90 days after request for a certification, the certifying authority must inform the applicant if any additional information is necessary for the certification authority to take an action on the request. As explained above, to the extent that the language requires the certifying authority to identify what, if any, information is necessary to submit a complete application for water quality certification, many state laws, including California's, do this. But the revised language may be construed as preventing the states from requesting that the applicant clarify, amplify, correct, or supplement information required in the application, which is permissible under state law. For these reasons, we write to ask that Congress preserve the existing state authority in Clean Water Act Section 401 to substantively review a project's effects on water quality before a federal permit or license is issued, and protect five decades of successful, cooperative federalism. Sincerely, Eileen Sobeck, Executive Director, California State Water Resources Control Board. Basil Seggos, Commissioner, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.

              "this amendment simply ensures that no undue influence can be wielded by the Chinese Communist Party using an existing provision, which I think reflects the overall sentiment behind this anti-CCP and forced labor provision of the entire bill. The underlying section allows the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to accept and expend funds from non-Federal entities in order to pay for staff and information technology system development to expedite permit processing. They are authorized to accept funds in fiscal years 2023 through 2025. This amendment prohibits those Secretaries from accepting contributions from non-Federal entities owned by the Communist Party of China or a person or entity acting on behalf of the Communist Party of China. Seems pretty common sense. There are already provisions in the bill which would prohibit the CCP's involvement in certain parts of our energy market. They should not be allowed to participate in this one any more than they do in the others. There is no reason that our government should be accepting money from this well. Let's remind ourselves that we are not talking about the people of China who wish to breathe free, like all people in the world do. We are talking about the Communist Party of China. We don't need anything from them. Mr. Speaker, I urge support and adoption of this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank the ranking member and appreciate bipartisan support on this very important amendment. I think this is a sign that we are making progress. This is a sign that America is coming together to stand up against the Chinese Communist Party. We need to stand up not only against them but we need to continue standing up against Russia, against OPEC. That is what H.R. 1 does. It is a bold step in the right direction, and this is a small part of it. I commend the gentleman from Tennessee for crafting this amendment and for getting it made in order. I support the amendment for a very good reason: We simply cannot let the Chinese Communist Party continue to dominate and take control of not only mineral supply chains but energy supply chains as they are trying to make a move in that area as well, where they are cozying up with the Saudis. They are working with Russia to buy the oil and gas that we have banned from there. Their objective is dominance. They have made great strides in the minerals area, and they are working very hard to do that in energy. The way we push back against China and the CCP is we produce our energy and minerals here, and we, for sure, don't let China come to America and own any kind of lease on Federal lands or private lands. We produce it ourselves. We send it to our allies. There was a delegation recently in Germany, and the message they brought back from Germany was gas equals peace. They want us to send them our gas, and we have ample supplies of it. We just need the pipelines. We need the ports. We need the LNG facilities. We need the vessels to send gas to Europe that is much cleaner than the gas they are getting from Russia. It will help bring peace in Europe if they can get more of our energy here. Mr. Speaker, I again commend the gentleman, and I support the amendment.",
              "I rise today in support of my amendment to require the Secretary of Energy to disclose certain stakeholder meetings with any entity that has: one, ties to the People's Republic of China or the Chinese Communist Party; two, has produced studies regarding or has advocated for policies to limit, restrict, or ban the use of any type of energy; and, three, has applied for or received Federal funds. We have recently seen concerning examples of anti-energy, China- connected entities receiving not just elevated access to the White House and Federal agencies but granting of funds, as well. Literally, we have been using U.S. taxpayer dollars to help fund them. I introduced this amendment because the Biden administration has not been transparent about who it has been meeting with, and frankly, I believe this administration has not been honest with the American people about its desire to ban gas stoves. In February of this year, it was widely reported that a government watchdog group obtained information through the Freedom of Information Act revealing a private meeting between the Secretary of Energy and a group that would be covered by this amendment. In particular, this group has been on the forefront of the effort to ban gas stoves. Unsurprisingly, when I sent a letter to Secretary Granholm in February, inquiring whether she was aware of this group's ties to China and the extent of their influence on the Department, I received a letter back that was completely ignoring my questions and concerns. I have to give you a little bit of perspective, Mr. Speaker. My family has been involved in construction for over three generations, and I fully understand the needs that people have at various levels in their homes and their businesses. I mean, we are talking about gas stoves today. Don't get me wrong. There is nothing inherently wrong with electric stoves. That oftentimes fits very nicely--same thing with electric base heat or water heaters, et cetera. There are certain regions of the country, like in Michigan and the upper Midwest, where we are very dependent on propane and natural gas. We don't have the electric grid to support an expansion of that. I know the other side will say that nobody is going to pull your stove out of your house--yet. Nobody is doing anything other than just stoves--yet. We know that places like California, New York, and even in Michigan, the city of Ann Arbor, have gone in and literally banned the addition of and use of gas stoves. They are looking to expand that. They have talked about that. The real rub here, Mr. Speaker, is that we have a major problem with questionable groups with established connections to China. They have those established connections, but we are not sure what their unanswered intentions might be. They are succeeding in influencing policy to limit affordable appliance options for Americans. When President Biden or Senate Majority Leader Schumer are telling the American people that no one is going after their stoves, they may be technically correct today, Mr. Speaker. In the broader picture, we know that that may be coming. I have to say that it is one thing for elected officials to be going after a particular appliance or source of energy, but we have a real problem when Washington bureaucrats, unelected bureaucrats, aren't being honest about their end goal, and they are the ones making the rules and regulations. A ban on gas stoves is going to cost the taxpayers. It is going to cost hardworking, honest Americans more when they are already in an inflationary heightened situation. That is why I wanted to bring this amendment. I appreciate the author's acceptance of this and understanding of where we are trying to go with this. At the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, my amendment is simply to bring an added dose of transparency, expose connections to the CCP, which I truly, honestly believe that both sides of the aisle have concerns about the tentacles of the CCP and the Chinese Government and the influence that it has gained here in the United States. That is why, on the Financial Services Committee that I serve on, we have done CFIUS reviews, which is making sure that it is property and technology and other things that we are protecting from our adversaries like China. Why would we hand over the keys to this particular kingdom? I don't understand. We need to let the American people know who is truly influencing our government and that exposure is there. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time."

              "I rise in support of the amendment I introduced in concurrence with Representative Lesko to defend America's ability to purchase and use natural gas stoves, a common household appliance found in over one-third of American households. Federal bureaucrats at the Department of Energy are threatening access to natural gas stoves for millions of Americans through the rulemaking process. This amendment would stop the DOE from denying Americans the freedom to cook on the range of their choosing. According to the Department of Energy's own analysis, in 2020, 38 percent of Americans used natural gas to cook in their homes. The Energy Information Administration says cooking with gas is three times cheaper than cooking with electricity. Americans should have access to the cooking appliances that they deem fit. They do not want or need the Federal Government to dictate what is in their kitchens. The Department of Energy's own research estimates that 50 percent of gas stoves on the market today don't meet the proposed standards, which means these households would have to remove them. This is a direct attack on natural gas consumption in this country and an example of the Biden administration's desire to control every decision we make. Americans should have the freedom to choose their appliances, and Federal Government intrusion is unwarranted and unwanted. Furthermore, this rule is essentially a tax on consumers, who are already being squeezed by inflation. My Democratic colleagues may argue that these rules were crafted with the purpose of saving consumers money. The DOE estimates the regulation would reduce energy use by 3.4 percent, resulting in a whopping $21.89 saved over a gas range's lifetime. This would save consumers $1.45 per year of the 15-year lifespan of a gas range. This minuscule savings indicates this regulation isn't actually about consumers' pocketbooks. It is about Federal control at the behest of the radical green policy groups. People should be free to choose their cooking appliances based on what they need rather than on what the government requires. If a consumer wants a gas stove that cooks faster, then they should be free to choose it, and if a consumer wants a gas stove that cooks slowly but more efficiently, then they should be free to choose that.",
              "I rise today in support of H.R. 1640, Representative Lesko's Save Our Gas Stoves Act. In my wildest imagination, I never thought I would be standing here defending my wife's gas stove. In nearly 40 percent of households across the country, including mine, the use of natural gas stoves are the preferred appliance to prepare family meals because it is affordable, reliable and, I might add, very stylish. Consumers deserve choice and the right to decide what goes in their dadgum kitchen. However, the Biden Department of Energy has issued a proposed rule that would impose more stringent standards on the use of a conventional cooking product such as a natural gas stove. This is ridiculous. This harmful proposed rule is yet another attempt by the Biden administration to push its radical climate agenda on the American people. I am going to tell you, the American people are getting sick of this, the high gas prices and all the other things, like the cost of natural gas today--you can't build pipelines--and this time in the form of mandating what kitchen appliances families can and cannot use. Mr. Speaker, 96 percent of the stove models that the Department of Energy tested failed to meet the proposed standard. If they implemented this rulemaking, it would impact the majority of gas stoves on the market. Not only would this cause significant market distortions, which is a problem the Biden administration has caused across the entire economic front, but implementing this proposed rule would also increase costs for consumers. Why, at a time when Americans are facing hyperinflation, would this administration propose a rule that would push consumers to a more expensive option? That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Save Our Gas Stoves Act, which will ensure that the Secretary of Energy does not implement an energy standard on cooking appliances that would reduce consumer choice. This bill also stops overreach by the Department of Energy. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill.",
              "In closing, let me just say that this is the second bill that came up today dealing with gas stoves. If there is one message that I really want to give to my colleagues, and urge them to vote against this bill, as well as the previous one, is that we are not banning gas stoves. I don't know how many times I can say that. The administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Department of Energy, all of them had made clear over and over again that we are not banning gas stoves. What we are doing in this case with this bill is to try to provide more energy efficiency, which has been something that the Department of Energy has done for years. We have given them the authority and urged them to deal with and come up with more efficient appliances, whether it is gas stoves, electric stoves, cooktops, whatever it happens to be. So why not let them do that? Why keep saying that we are banning gas stoves when we are not? Why keep suggesting that somehow eliminating the Department of Energy's ability to adopt more efficiency standards for these appliances is not a good thing? It saves money. It makes sense. I heard my colleagues on the other side talk about the middle class, about working people. Working people want to save money. They want more efficiency. Overwhelmingly, polls show that they believe that appliances should be more efficient. I think that when people buy things and go to the appliance store or to the supermarket, or wherever they are buying appliances, they not only expect that those appliances are safe and safe for themselves and for their kids, but they also think that the Federal Government is trying to do things to make things more efficient. There is no reason why we shouldn't. For those reasons, I would ask my colleagues to vote to oppose this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

              "this week my Republican colleagues are fast-tracking a bill that puts polluters over people, H.R. 1. Let's be clear: This bill won't do anything, not one thing to help American consumers and families to lower their energy costs. Yes, we do want that light on, but this bill is not going to help us get there. Instead, it would simply repeal household energy rebates passed by House Democrats, like those from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. We shouldn't have to choose between dirty air and polluted water just to meet the energy needs of the future. We simply don't have to. We could work together in a bipartisan way to address energy costs, but extreme MAGA Republicans refuse to do that. We could work together on issues like the electrical grid liability and security, an issue that is all too important to us in my home State of Texas. Instead, Republican-backed H.R. 1 picks winners and losers. The wealthy and well-connected win and workers lose. I stand with workers. Workers in my district know that new energy jobs and clean energy jobs are the jobs of the future. We depend on them. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this bill because this bill does not protect those workers. I urge my colleagues to do the same. Oppose this bill.",
              "I rise today to call attention to how Republicans' polluters energy package will do little of nothing to finally--and I have to censor my poster here, Mr. Speaker--fix the grid once and for all. In February 2021, my own State of Texas had a catastrophic grid failure during a deadly winter storm that caused 246 deaths and left 5 million people in record cold temperatures without heat and businesses without power. Last summer, Texans again had to deal with the dangerous and unexpected generation failures that put further strain on our State's electric grid. These extreme weather events are not unique to Texas. Despite these continued problems of grid resiliency, the Republican- led package we are voting on will do little of nothing to actually fix the grid. It is, in fact, harmful. It is hyperpartisan. This package will make the grid less stable. We need to make investments in electric transmissions to meet our energy needs, create good-paying jobs, and have cleaner air to breathe. This package will do little to address the lower energy costs for people across north Texas. Not only will it not help constituents pay their energy bills, but CBO estimates that this bill will actually increase the deficit over the 2023-2033 period by roughly $2.4 billion. That is why I urge my Republican colleagues to stop putting polluters over people and meet us in the middle to pass a bipartisan, comprehensive solution that bolsters our Nation's energy independence, helps the middle class, and finally fixes the grid. Fix the grid, Mr. Speaker.",
              "let me first commend Ranking Member Raul Grijalva for fighting the good fight every day. I rise today to oppose the polluters over people act. It is an extreme MAGA Republican bill that will increase pollution by lowering environmental standards. It will increase climate change by removing a lot of provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act designed to combat climate change. It also increases the deficit. According to the Congressional Budget Office, it will increase the deficit by over $2.4 billion just on one bill alone. It is like a triple threat of badness. It increases pollution, it increases global warming, and it increases the deficit. Now, let's just take a review of what we have done up to now. Last term when Democrats were in control, we passed laws that moved the American family forward. We passed the American Rescue Plan that got our economy back on track as we were coming out of a pandemic. We then followed that up with the infrastructure law to rebuild roads, bridges, and highways; to take lead out of water pipes; and to put broadband everywhere from rural areas to inner cities and everywhere in between. We then followed that up with the CHIPS and Science Act. That is going to bring manufacturing back to the United States. Then we followed that up with the Inflation Reduction Act, which not only helped reduce the deficit--Democrats reduced the deficit by over $1.7 trillion last year--but that Inflation Reduction Act also had the highest number of climate change projects and the highest amount of climate change funding in world history. This term when Republicans took control, what did you all do? Well, let me tell you. You read the Constitution on the House floor. You took turns doing that. You also held not one, but two congressional hearings complaining about Twitter. It is more than just stupid stuff. Extreme MAGA Republicans are trying to pass extreme MAGA Republican bills like H.R. 1 that is going to, again, increase climate change, increase pollution, and increase the deficit. It is also a monumental waste of time, because guess what? This bill ain't going anywhere. It is not going to pass the Senate, because you need to override a filibuster. That ain't gonna happen. Even if it miraculously does pass the Senate, the administration has already signaled they are going to veto it. We are just wasting time here when we should be focused on more relevant issues like how do we prevent gun violence at schools. My heart goes out to the victims of the tragic mass shooting yesterday in Nashville. Three of the victims were 9-year-old children. Recently, a member of the Republican Caucus from Tennessee was asked what we are going to do to fix school violence. His answer was: We are not going to fix it. Well, Democrats have a different view. Instead of wasting time on political stunts like H.R. 1, let's pass universal background checks into law."

              "I rise today in support of H.R. 1, Lower Energy Costs Act, an actual solution to the problems we are facing. We have seen what happens abroad when Nations are at the mercy of energy imports from nefarious actors. We have seen what happens at home when energy prices skyrocket and families struggle to pay for gas and groceries. That is why I am a staunch supporter of this bill and the mission behind it. H.R. 1 is an important step toward unleashing American energy, lowering prices, and strengthening our energy supply chains. The American government should not be in the business of picking winners and losers. We need an all-of-the-above energy approach. Increasing production and untangling energy from overly burdensome red tape is key toward providing certainty and stability to American businesses, consumers, and families. That is why I support this bill, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.",
              "When we were in the majority, Democrats, we passed H.R. 1. What was that about? It was not about elections. It was about our democracy. It was about protecting that democracy. After January 6, that became urgent. Now, some might want to deny that--that was just a walk in the park, people taking a stroll. We were here. We knew what was going on, and the American people knew what was going on. The issue of patriotism has been brought up. It is patriotic for us to oppose polluters over people. It is patriotic because we care and feel that the public health of the American people needs to be protected, that we have to deal with climate and the crisis that we are confronting. To question the patriotism of those instincts is wrong, and we will continue to represent the American people on their most urgent needs. The future and their destinies shouldn't be turned over to Big Oil and Big Gas and the mining industry, for them to determine that future. They have to have a role, and our statutes and the protections that are in our laws need to be part of that role. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).",
              "I yield myself the balance of my time for closing. Mr. Speaker, I thank my Democrat colleagues for their comments, both from the Committee on Natural Resources members and other colleagues that came forth to speak against the polluters over people act, H.R. 1. Republican Members have produced an extreme piece of legislation. As I listened to the rationale today, there were four or five things that were repeated over and over again. It is an extreme piece and a high cost to pay for a speakership, but nevertheless, the rationale today was, as I heard it, patriotism. If you vote ``no'' for H.R. 1, you don't believe in America and you are not a patriot; you support China, Russia, Venezuela, OPEC, and communism. Unfortunately, that is a desperate lie and unnecessary in this debate. The other rationale I heard: Let the polluters drive energy policy, production, and the safeguards that the American people need. That was one of the rationales. The other one that struck me is collateral damage. Tribes, poor people, 40 million Americans, communities of color, once again, they get thrown under the bus to satisfy the greed of polluters. The issues of environmental justice are almost eliminated and downplayed in this whole discussion. That is 40 million people. That is collateral damage that cannot be tolerated and should not be. You ignore climate change. You blame other nations and ask Americans to accept a lower bar for themselves and give up the opportunity, as we always have, to historically lead in this world of ours. This act is about taxpayer subsidies to a powerful and rich polluter industry that doesn't need the support. It dismantles fundamental public health, clean air, clean water, NEPA, environmental protections, and judicial review. We need to remember that this act, H.R. 1, polluters over people, deals with a very consequential issue, and that is the consequential issue of life. H.R. 1 is dangerous to life. The real true act of patriotism, I remind my colleagues, is our responsibility and our oath to protect lives, to extend the future, to deal with fairness and the public's right to know and the public to have a voice in their future. H.R. 1, the polluters over people act, undoes all of that. Do we want to go back to the good old days when the rivers were burning, we were clear-cutting forests, when it was all right to admit wrongdoing and not have any consequences? Those are not the good old days that people want to go back to. If we are going to deal with the climate challenge and the climate action that is needed in this crisis, H.R. 1 needs to be defeated. It is the right thing to do, it is the American thing to do, and it is the patriotic thing to do. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1 is dangerous and needs to be defeated. I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time."

              "I rise in support of this amendment. The provisions of this bill, such as Representative Graves' BUILDER Act, would streamline the inefficient and costly NEPA process. It is costly in more than just dollars. It is costly to our environment. It is costly in human lives. As the gentleman explained, we can do better managing our forests. When we keep these forests healthy, we are protecting human life. We are protecting property. We are also protecting the very, very thing that does more to support and help the environment than anything else, and it is our forest. It is a tragedy that we send up so much of our forest in smoke. This NEPA process, although it is streamlining, will help to produce more domestic energy. It will also help to build infrastructure. It will help to take care of our national forest and Federal lands. Mr. Speaker, this is a good amendment. I support it, and I encourage others to support it.",
              "I thank the chairman for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, this administration's regulatory assault on American energy production has been devastating for my constituents in the Central Valley. Every week, I hear from my neighbors, friends, and constituents about the skyrocketing price of monthly energy bills. Over the summer, people in California were paying over $6 per gallon for gas. It is unacceptable that even though America has some of the greatest energy resources of any nation in the world, my constituents are having trouble putting gas in their tanks and food on their tables. That is why I am proud to support the Lower Energy Costs Act, and I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same. This bill will cut red tape and allow us to increase our supply of safe, clean, and affordable energy. I am proud that language from my bill, the NEPA Adequacy Streamlining Act, is included in this bill. This makes the approval of new energy projects easier by allowing the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to use previously conducted environmental assessments for similar projects. This is a commonsense reform that removes one of the many layers of bureaucratic red tape in our permitting process. This bill is full of the same types of policies that streamline our energy production to increase our supply of clean, affordable energy. I want to respond to some of the opponents of this bill. My Democratic colleagues claim that this legislation is harmful to our environment. This is just not true. America has some of the strictest environmental standards of any nation in the world. When we produce energy here, we do it cleaner and safer than countries we would be importing it from. Something important to remember is that decreasing domestic production does not reduce the demand for energy. Reducing our ability to produce oil and gas in the U.S. just increases our reliance on foreign countries for these imports. That means instead of using clean energy we produce here and creating good-paying American jobs in the process, we are reliant on imports from countries like Russia and Venezuela that are not held to the same environmental standards we have here in the U.S. If your argument is that you want to reduce emissions, then increasing U.S. energy production is how you do it. Despite wishes from the President and the far left, we cannot abandon traditional energy sources like oil and gas. While we as a country should continue to develop and pursue other energy sources, we will still need oil and gas for a long time. Why not produce it here in the U.S.? I support an all-of-the-above approach to energy production and use, but that does not mean immediately transitioning to 100 percent renewable fuels. Until alternative energy sources are more reliable, we will continue to need transitional fuels. If my Democratic colleagues cared about the environment as much as they say they do, then supporting the increased production of clean and reliable American-made energy should be a no-brainer. Passing the Lower Energy Costs Act is a critical step to lowering prices, creating good-paying jobs, and strengthening our national security. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill.",
              "everything around us that makes our lives possible is either mined, or it is grown. Everything. Above the Speaker's chair is a plea from Daniel Webster to those who serve in this House. ``Let us develope the resources of our land, call forth its powers . . . and see whether we also, in our day and generation may not perform something worthy to be remembered.'' Yet, for 50 years, the environmental left has slowly strangled our Nation's ability to do just that. In the process, it is impoverishing the American people. One of its most powerful weapons is the National Environmental Policy Act imposed in 1969 with the promise that it would protect the environment. It has done exactly the opposite. It has made it endlessly time consuming and ultimately cost prohibitive to manage our forests, to provide abundant water for our people, and to prosper from our vast energy and mineral resources. My district comprises the forests of the Sierra Nevada and the agricultural heartland of California's Central Valley. The left promised us that NEPA would protect our forests and water resources. Come to my district, and you will see what a cruel and demonstrable lie that has become. Excess timber is removed from our forests in only two ways. If we don't carry it out, nature will burn it out. Throughout the 20th century, the U.S. Forest Service marked off surplus timber and auctioned it to logging companies that paid us to remove it. The result was healthy, resilient, and fire-resistant Federal forests, a steady revenue source for forest improvements, and thriving mountain economies. Then came the National Environmental Policy Act. Simple forest thinning projects now require an average of 4\\1/2\\ years of environmental studies, costing millions of dollars, more than the value of the timber. Instead of making money for the government, removing excess timber now costs us money. As a result, our forests have become morbidly overgrown, carrying four times the timber that the land can support. In that stressed condition, the trees succumb to disease, pestilence, drought, and ultimately catastrophic wildfires we haven't seen in over a century. California is one of the most water-rich regions of the country. Yet, the farms of the Central Valley have had their water systematically choked off because NEPA and other environmental laws make major new reservoirs all but impossible to build. Record rainfall this year is being lost to the ocean simply because we have no place to store it. When the little town of Foresthill tried to add a $2 million spillway gate for additional water storage, they discovered that because of NEPA, they also had to budget an additional $1 million for environmental reviews and $2 million for environmental mitigation. After more than a decade, the project has yet to be built. The last reservoir over a million acre-feet constructed in California was completed in 1979. Meanwhile, the State's population has nearly doubled. Mr. Speaker, when something is plentiful, it is cheap. When it is scarce, it is expensive. NEPA is making everything we depend upon in our lives increasingly scarce, and therefore, increasingly expensive. The left obsesses over a 1-degree rise in temperature over the next century, but they couldn't care less that they are making it impossible for people to heat their homes in subfreezing winters. They promise us they care about the environment, but they couldn't care less that entire human communities' and species' habitats and millions of acres of forest are being laid to waste by preventable mega fires. They obsess over the snail darter but couldn't care less that they have destroyed thousands of agricultural jobs, idled a half million acres of California farmland, and sent grocery prices skyrocketing. They promised us that NEPA would protect our forests. Instead, it is destroying them. H.R. 1 begins to dial back the damage that NEPA has done, both to the environment and to the quality of life of all Americans, simply by reducing the time and cost required for these massive bureaucratic studies. The question before us is whether our children will grow up in a world of scarcity, poverty, and misery or one of abundance, prosperity, and optimism. That is the simple question before us. We choose prosperity; a future of abundant and affordable energy, water, food, lumber, minerals, and all the material comforts and benefits that flow from the resources our country has been blessed with. That is something worthy to be remembered, and that future can begin with this vote today."

We have spoken about the link between hard rock minerals and national security today, but there is one resource highlighted by this amendment that must be discussed, and that is uranium. Domestic uranium is essential for national security, given its role in nuclear deterrence and empowering the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. Uranium also supports the United States biomedical community because it is vital to the production of medical isotopes. As the gentleman has pointed out, the majority of our uranium supply comes from Russia and former Soviet Bloc countries, unfortunately. We have ample deposits of uranium here in the United States. We just have to mine it and process it, and we need to use more of it to create more nuclear power. I thank the gentleman for bringing this amendment. I support it.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 1042, the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act, which I introduced with Mr. Latta. American leadership in nuclear energy and nuclear technology is critical to our economic and national security. One of the most urgent security threats America faces right now is our dangerous reliance on Russia's supply of nuclear fuels for our nuclear fleet. This threat has intensified as a result of the war in Ukraine. American nuclear fuel infrastructure has been stunted by policies that Russia has exploited by flooding the U.S. market with this cheaper fuel. Today that accounts for more than 20 percent of our nuclear fuels for American reactors. Last year alone, our industry paid over $800 million to Russia's state-owned nuclear energy corporation, Rosatom and its fuel subsidiaries. That number could be even higher this year, and these resources are no doubt going towards funding Putin's war efforts in Ukraine. Further, we have seen how Putin has weaponized Europe's reliance on Russian natural gas. There is no reason to believe that Russia wouldn't do the same with our nuclear fuel supply if Putin saw an opportunity. Rosatom has also supported China's nuclear energy ambitions. The risks of continuing this dependence on Russia for our nuclear fuel are simply too great. It is weakening America's nuclear fuel infrastructure, which has significantly declined because of the reliance on these cheap fuels. That is why I am leading H.R. 1042. Our bill bans fuel imports from Russia and sends a strong signal to the market that will help ensure America's nuclear leadership and fuel infrastructure. Our legislation also provides waivers to cover any supply gaps leading up to 2028, at which point no more Russian fuel will be allowed to be imported into the U.S. This bill both protects any short-term needs of the industry and provides the long-term certainty necessary to build out American capacity, as well as European capacity that serves our markets. H.R. 1042 has bipartisan support from the Committee on Energy and Commerce. It also has support from the nuclear industry, the nuclear fuels industry, and policy advocates. Additionally, the Biden administration has also said that a ban on Russian fuels is necessary to advance our domestic fuel build-out, including the fuels for advanced reactors. Across Europe, utility providers are starting to transition away from Russian fuels, announce new capacity, and invest in plant projects. We are seeing important fuel processes returning online in the United States. For example, the uranium conversion facility in Metropolis, Illinois, has restarted operations for the first time in years. That facility alone could meet the domestic uranium conversion needs within 2 years, but only if they have assurances that cheap Russian fuel won't undercut their business. The reality is, no facility owner is going to be able to invest to expand production capacity without the certainty of long-term contracts for their products. Those long-term contracts from fuel customers, the utility companies, will not be written if there remains uncertainty about Russian fuel continuing to flow into the United States, and the risk that Russia will once again be able to flood the market with cheaper products. H.R. 1042 provides those assurances to industry. American leadership in nuclear energy and nuclear technology is critical to our economic, energy, and national security, and a strong domestic nuclear fuel system, from mining to enrichment, is vital to our leadership. In the U.S. alone, nuclear energy provides nearly 20 percent of our electricity generation, all of which is emissions free. Nuclear plants operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, making them one of the most reliable, zero-carbon, baseload energy resources. H.R. 1042 will protect the short-term needs of the nuclear industry and provide the long-term certainty necessary to encourage investment and secure a durable domestic supply of fuel. I urge my colleagues to support the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act to restore our industry and take down Russia's nuclear fuel empire. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1042, the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act. Our imports of Russian nuclear fuel date back to the megatons for megawatts disarmament program at the end of the Cold War. That program has been over for a decade now, and we have developed a dependence on Russian uranium. Our Nation's nuclear reactors currently depend on Russia for nearly 15 percent of their enriched uranium. This is troubling because over the last 2 years we have seen how Russia tries to wield its energy resources as a weapon. It is simply unsustainable. I support ending our dangerous reliance on Russia for enriched uranium, but if we are serious about energy security, we cannot simply switch one foreign dependence for another. That is why we must invest in our own uranium fuel cycle here at home. Right now, we have limited fuel facilities to provide the nuclear fuel our existing fleet needs, much less the advanced fuels that future reactors will need. Any move we make to end our reliance on Russian uranium must be partnered with a build-out of our domestic uranium supply chain. Otherwise, any action would just increase cost to consumers and impact reliability. That is why in committee, Democrats attempted to partner this bill with authorizations to the Department of Energy to invest in U.S. domestic enrichment and conversion capacity. Unfortunately, those efforts were initially rejected by our Republican majority, therefore, I opposed this bill at that time. Fortunately, the committee has now advanced legislation that authorizes those investments in our domestic fuel cycle, and that language will be included in the final defense authorization bill. With that legislation set to become law, I am now much more comfortable moving this bill. After passage of the defense authorization bill, we must ensure these important programs are funded at the levels authorized so we can finally end our dangerous reliance on Russian uranium. The combination of banning imports of Russian uranium and investing in domestic capacity will provide private industry with both the certainty and the incentives it needs to invest in the nuclear fuel supply chain. This will help us become a world leader again, not just in fuel production for our current reactors, but in fuel production for the next generation of reactors, as well. I urge support for this bill, Mr. Speaker. I ask that we support this bill on a bipartisan basis. It is a good bill at this point, and we want to get it to the Senate as quickly as possible. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

              "I appreciate the work that the chairman and the committee have done on this very important piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about why we need H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act. I can't think of anybody in this country, especially working folks, especially the people in the Second Congressional District, who I represent, that say to me: Tim, I need to pay more for my energy. They don't. They say: My energy costs are out of sight. We have to feed our kids. We have to buy books for school. We have to buy clothing for our kids. We can't afford these higher energy costs. The Biden administration, unfortunately, and the Democrats in Congress keep pushing these Green New Deal-style agendas. Honestly, Mr. Speaker, they just don't work. There hasn't been a new development in solar in over 20 years, and windmills are just what they are. The wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine in east Tennessee, and I am sure that is the way it is across this great Nation. It is costing Americans way too much. We are done with all this nonsense, Mr. Speaker. H.R. 1 is going to end restrictions on importing and exporting natural gas. What could be wrong with that? Why in the world are we doing business with our enemies, the people we continue to send money to? We have hundreds of years, by recent estimates, of gas in the ground that we could be getting out using safe and environmentally sound methods. The burning apparatus now is so much safer than when this was first started, it is ridiculous. We need to fix this permitting process. We keep saying--and I have heard the White House say many times through their spokesperson--that we are permitting all these wells. Well, they don't permit the pipeline to get there. It is like we have a gallon of fuel in the ground and we are trying to pull it out with something about as big around as a needle point. We have to process our energy projects so they can get off the ground in a reasonable amount of time. By the time we get to the end of it, the cost is so high that it is very cost-prohibitive. We have to make the Biden administration resume the lease on most of our Federal lands and waters that they have restricted. We have to roll back President Biden's $27 billion slush fund for these Democrat special interest groups and these projects that amount to nothing but woke policy changes. We have to stop the liberal States from abusing section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which they use to add a bunch of unnecessary red tape to every project they don't like. It seems like when we find a good resource, they put these barriers in place. It is just not right. Mr. Speaker, we need to focus on keeping Americans' homes heated and their lights on. Nothing should be more important, especially since we are forced to purchase it from our enemies overseas--the people that hate our guts. They love our dollars. We pay them and the next thing you know, they are burning our flag. They are saying things about us that aren't true. They are causing us all kinds of problems. The best energy solution, Mr. Speaker, above all, is the solution that we need oil, gas, and nuclear energy--like they are working on at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. It is not in the district that I represent, but it backs up to where I am. There are over 6,000 people who work there that live in my district. It is also home to Big Ed's Pizza, which is a wonderful place--I will just throw that in. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1 is going to spur energy innovation at home, and I am proud to support it. I appreciate the great work that has been done on this issue.",
              "I thank the gentleman, who is doing a great job as chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, for yielding. Mr. Speaker, what should be crystal clear by now is that our friends across the aisle do not have solutions to the energy crisis. For the last 4 years, Democrats have controlled both Chambers of Congress, but in that time, not one single piece of serious legislation was ever introduced which would have lowered the cost of energy. After seeing costs rise for years on end, voters decided that they had had enough and elected Republicans to solve this crisis. In 2019, a gallon of gas cost just over $2. Today, it costs almost $4. The price of groceries has gone up, as the price of energy to ship and keep them cool has gone up as well. Some items have seen as high as a 55 percent increase. What has been done to help ease energy costs? What solutions do my friends across the aisle have? As a result of President Biden's Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the United States pumped $75.8 billion of taxpayer money into unreliable green tech. Besides that, Americans have pumped trillions of both public and private dollars into these industries for decades, but solar and wind combined still only make up 10 percent of American electricity generation. Instead of making existing technology more affordable, this administration and its allies in Congress dumped billions of dollars into technologies that cannot provide reliable and dispatchable energy to even a fraction of the country. This so-called solution has done nothing to lower costs for the average American. We have higher costs. There is more potential for rolling brownouts. This is the best that my friends across the aisle can do. An intelligent person would think, why not continue to invest in affordable and proven technology while we are waiting for these alternatives to become viable? They might be in the future at some point. That is great. But right now it is only 10 percent of our national electrical production. The PJM Interconnection, for example, which is a grid that services over 65 million people, has announced that they will be short 26 percent of their total energy obligations because radical environmentalists are retiring energy sources while providing no reliable backups. EPA also recently finalized what they are calling the ``Good Neighbor'' rule by denying 26 different State plans to conform to EPA ozone regulations. This denial means that 26 States, including my State of Colorado, will have sources of energy generation completely shut down while having no viable backup whatsoever. This decision guarantees that costs and shortages will continue to increase for the American people with no end in sight. Maintaining affordable energy is crucial to our way of life. It is what keeps water treatment plants open. It is what keeps hospitals open. It is what keeps traffic lights, libraries, schools, trucks, ships, and airplanes operating. When the cost of powering these essential processes go up, costs go up. If the grid shuts down, everything relying upon it goes down. This will have catastrophic consequences. Those of us around the country have seen what happens in places like California with its unrealistic energy policies and want nothing to do with it. High prices and shortages come with overregulation. Let's face the facts: Current green tech cannot come anywhere close to powering our Nation right now or in the foreseeable future. The Energy Information Administration expects fossil fuel demand to continue rising, not decreasing, beyond the year 2050. Ironically, as an aside, fossil fuel industries have always made a higher profit when there is a Democratic President because of the increased per barrel price of oil, but that is just an aside. Republicans also aren't neglecting permitting realities by ignoring unused drilling permits. We simply recognize that those permits on their own are insufficient to generate investment and production, especially when this administration is doing everything it can to discourage the producers of conventional energy. What should be clear in this debate is that Republicans are the ones who know how energy works, and we are passing legislation. H.R. 1 is serious legislation that will lower costs. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.",
              "I can make posters, too. I think I got the right backdrop there. Let's talk a little bit about credibility. Let's talk a little bit about the challenges that this country is experiencing, like the little girl on the playground and what our families across America are experiencing right now. Let's talk about why. This body is about credibility. It is about your word. Let's talk a little bit about why America is experiencing the challenges that they are. We are seeing higher electricity prices that are making American families unable to be able to afford medicine and groceries, refuel their car, or pay electricity bills. Why is that happening? It is happening because my friends across the aisle have refused to produce American energy. It is a supply and demand issue. This happened when they gained power. The day the President of the United States was inaugurated, Mr. Speaker, gasoline prices in my home State were as low as a $1.74 a gallon. Let me ask you, where in the world are you going to find that today? You have cut off production of oil and gas. Don't take my word for it. You know, one term I have never heard anybody say is bring back that Jimmy Carter energy policy. Yet, when Jimmy Carter was President, he leased 100 times more acres of the lands and waters for energy production. Why do we have a crisis in energy right now? It was self-inflicted. Why has this administration and these Democrats sold off hundreds of millions of barrels of oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the emergency reserve that was designed for crises, not awful policy? It is because they refused to produce energy. You have created a supply problem, and you are using our emergency reserves to address it. You sit here and also raise royalty rates. You proposed increased pipeline fees. You proposed taxes or enacted taxes on American energy, all driving up the costs, then you sit here and wonder why we have high prices? These were all self-inflicted wounds. You did this to America-- your policies. Mr. Speaker, it is remarkable seeing what is going on right now, listening to my friends across the aisle talking about the environment. Yet, their own legislation requires the use of critical minerals that they at the same time have banned or prevented from being mined or processed or refined in the United States. In some cases, China has 80 percent of these critical minerals locked up. If you force markets in the direction and if you force the use of those strategic materials, and the only place that has it is China, who are you benefiting? China loves their energy policies. They benefit from it. All roads lead to China. Over 80 percent of the solar panels are made in China. Whenever this administration found that China was illegally subsidizing and illegally dumping solar panels in the United States, they banned them and put tariffs on them. China then starts sending them through other countries. And you know what this administration does? They say: Yeah, that is fine. They acknowledge that there were Chinese solar panels being sent through other countries, and they allowed it. The Biden administration allowed it, and my friends across the aisle have done nothing to stop it. The truth is, is that emissions have gone up under their policies, not down. Mr. Speaker, let me say that again. Under the previous administration, emissions went down. Greenhouse gas emissions went down an average of 2\\1/2\\ percent a year. In the first year of the Biden administration, my friends across the aisle working with them closely, emissions went up 6 percent last year and went up another 1.3 or 1.4 percent. I am going to say it again. My friends across the aisle and their policies have resulted in higher greenhouse gas emissions. They have increased our dependence upon foreign energy sources. We had the Secretary of the Interior standing right in our committee, and he wasn't even aware that we had become increasingly dependent upon Russian energy. They talk about corporate welfare. I agree, which is why the over $600 billion that my friends across the aisle have put toward effectively bribing companies into investing in renewable energy sources that in many cases are not economic, simply doesn't make sense. This bill follows logic. It follows good policy. It ensures that we are getting energy resources from the United States. It ensures the affordability by bringing American energy online. It results in lower global emissions. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation."

              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 342, the Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2023 introduced by my friend, Representative Obernolte. H.R. 342 is a good-government bill that does exactly what it says it will: it improves accountability. When making awards, the Department of Energy is subject to cost-share requirements for most research, development, demonstration, and commercial application activities. DOE can modify or eliminate those requirements when necessary, an authority which has been critical to supporting and developing new technologies. This bill is very simple. It requires DOE to submit a quarterly report to Congress describing the instances where they have modified or waived those cost-share requirements. The bill also makes those reports publicly available. H.R. 342 doesn't prevent DOE from waiving cost-share requirements. It just ensures that those decisions are made public. This transparency and accountability is important because it allows us to ensure we are making the best possible use of taxpayer resources. It is a smart, bipartisan policy. I thank Representative Obernolte and Representative Foster for working on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I thank my colleague, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas) for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 342, the Cost- Sharing Accountability Act. Mr. Speaker, research and development grants in the field of energy administered by the Department of Energy play a critical role in innovation and energy research in the United States. The administration and awarding of those grants is governed by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Among other things, that act requires the DOE to impose a cost share on the recipients of those grants. That cost share can be as low as 20 percent in the case of research and development grants, or as high as 50 percent in the case of commercialization and demonstration grants. The purpose of this cost share is simple. It is to ensure that the grant recipients also have some skin in the game when it comes to ensuring the success of the grants and the projects that they are bidding on and demonstrating. Several months ago, the Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology held an oversight hearing in which we investigated the occasions on which the Department of Energy had waived those cost-sharing requirements on grants that it had awarded. The DOE has the statutory ability to waive those cost shares under the appropriate circumstances. We wanted to make sure that that authority was being exercised judiciously. Although we found that the DOE was appropriately waiving those cost shares under those circumstances, we were very surprised by the lack of transparency in that process and equally surprised by the difficulty with which the subcommittee had in acquiring the information about how often the DOE was waiving those cost shares. Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 342, is a very simple solution to that problem. It will require the DOE to make quarterly reports to the committees of jurisdiction in both the House and the Senate on the occasions and the circumstances under which it waives cost-share requirements for the grants that it awards. This will enhance Congress' ability to exercise oversight over the DOE. Equally importantly, it will impose greater transparency into this process for the parties that apply for these grants, and it will demonstrate the circumstances under which the DOE would consider waiving those cost-share requirements. Mr. Speaker, this is basic good governance. It is an oversight bill. I hope it is something that we all on both sides of the aisle can support. I thank my cosponsor, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster), for his leadership on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 342.",
              "I rise in support of H.R. 342--``The Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2023.'' H.R. 342 requires the Department of Energy to report quarterly to Congress on the use of the department's authority to reduce or eliminate cost-sharing requirements for various research, development, and demonstration projects. Specifically, this bill aims to establish the necessary requirements to effectively set the standards for quarterly reporting to Congress in order to ensure proper management of capital allotment between energy departments. Mr. Speaker, The Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 2005 (Public Law 109- 58), the underlying statute of H.R. 342 which provides the background history for H.R. 342, calls for the development of grant programs, demonstration and testing initiatives, and tax incentives that promote alternative fuels and advanced vehicles production and use. H.R. 342--``The Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2023'' will provide advancements towards energy innovations that will benefit both the state of energy independence of the United States as well as critical energy advancements for the future. The Secretary of Energy has the authority to reduce or eliminate cost sharing requirements for applied research and development as necessary and appropriate. Moreover, the Secretary may reduce cost sharing requirements for demonstration and commercial application activities as necessary and appropriate, taking into consideration any technological risk relating to the activity. Mr. Speaker, based on the S&P Global macroeconomic model completed on January 5th, it is expected that the U.S. real GDP will grow by 0.5 percent in 2023, with economic growth returning after contraction in the first quarter of 2023. In 2024, the estimated real GDP will grow by 1.9 percent, driven primarily by an increase in household consumption. This means that there will be relatively flat economic growth in 2023 resulting in total U.S. energy consumption falling by 0.9 percent in the forecast. However, total energy consumption then rises by 1.0 percent in 2024. This evidence provides us a basis for making sure we have the proper standards in place for effective accounting for key departments performing various research, development, and demonstration projects. As a senior Member of the Budget Committee, I understand the importance of providing clarity and transparency to the American people on the allocation of funds. I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of H.R. 342, ``The Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2023'' so we can provide transparency to the American people while addressing the proper implementations towards efficient allotment of cost-sharing."

              "I rise in support of this amendment. The Biden administration will stop at nothing in its war on American energy. Democrats' next target is Americans' home appliances, including stoves, your furnace, and your hot water heater. In the last 2 years, we have seen far-reaching regulatory proposals and executive orders to restrict the use of natural gas. As we speak, DOE is proposing to ban more than half of the gas stoves currently on the market. Some States, like California and New York, are going even further to ban natural gas pipelines and the sale of gas- powered appliances and equipment. The American people are paying for these gas bans in the form of higher prices and surging utility bills. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment so that the GAO can study the true cost of gas bans.",
              "I rise in support of this amendment. The amendment would stop the Department of Energy from implementing punitive regulations to ban natural gas stoves. Earlier this year, we learned that the Biden administration was considering a nationwide ban on gas stoves when Consumer Product Safety Commissioner Trumka said gas stoves were a hidden hazard, and all options are on the table to restrict their use. Weeks later, the DOE issued a proposed efficiency rule that would ban up to 96 percent of existing stoves on the market. DOE's punitive regulations to ban gas stoves is a massive expansion of their statutory authority. DOE should be focused on expanding energy options rather than banning them. DOE's regulatory assault will force the American people to change out their reliable gas stoves for more expensive and less reliable electric appliances. This amendment would stop DOE from banning those gas stoves, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support.",
              "my amendment simply requires a study to look at the impact that a ban on natural gas appliances would have on electricity prices. In my home State of New York, Governor Kathy Hochul has proposed to implement a ban on gas-powered appliances, including gas stoves, beginning in 2025, less than just 2 years from now. The notion that the State is going to tell New Yorkers that they can't use the most affordable option to heat their homes or cook their dinner is beyond belief. This proposal will undoubtedly increase the demand and cost for electricity, which is already incredibly expensive for my constituents in upstate New York, all spending hundreds, even thousands of dollars more for their electricity. My amendment will shed light on the costs of Governor Hochul's proposal and what that cost will have on New Yorkers, and by extension, all Americans. This is not a partisan issue. My Democratic colleagues should join me in seeking transparency and identifying the effects that this proposal and others like it will have on the cost of electricity. H.R. 1, the bill in chief, delivers on our commitment to lower energy costs for the American people, and I wholeheartedly support it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

Then how does the FERC--do they just issue another draft saying here is another way to look at it? I just think this is very confusing. I do think FERC should take into consideration greenhouse gas emissions. They are required to by the law. Unless the gentleman is going to change that, it makes no sense to say that they can't get industry input about how they do that. Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "the amendment that I am offering here directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, as we refer to it, to withdraw two policy statements that massively expand the role of climate hysteria in certification of natural gas infrastructure, like pipelines and LNG export terminals. In February 2022, FERC released two radical policy statements that massively increased the role that the emissions play in its certification of natural gas pipelines and LNG export terminals, which are so critical to our ability to affect world consumption of gas so that we can drive down CO2 and expand our role in the world and expand American energy interests. This included requiring FERC to consider the upstream and downstream impact on emissions that building a new natural gas pipeline would have. Even Senator Manchin said: ``The Commission went too far by prioritizing a political agenda over their main mission--ensuring our Nation's energy reliability and security.'' I want everybody to hear this. This move by FERC came 1 week before Russia invaded Ukraine. This administration is perfectly fine empowering our enemies to appease the climate activists, the climate cult. We saw it with Nord Stream 2. We see it right here. We refuse to expand American energy right when we could be sticking it to Putin. Instead, we have everybody over here clamoring about what we need to do in Ukraine instead of having gotten in front of that by exporting American energy, by making sure that we control the world's supply of energy by putting out clean-burning American natural gas. Just 1 week after FERC made this move, Russia invaded Ukraine, massively disrupting European natural gas supplies. When the Western world was begging for U.S. LNG, this administration was giving them the middle finger to appease the climate cult. Meanwhile, our enemies--China, Iran, Russia, Venezuela--are massively pumping out emissions. China has 1,100 coal-fired plants. They are adding two a week. We are not adding squat to our natural gas or coal production capacity. Texas is about to be 50 percent wind and solar because we refuse to actually produce the coal and gas necessary to have power on a cloudy, windless day. China accounts for 30 percent of global emissions--and increasing. Russian natural gas exports to Europe release 41 percent more emissions than U.S. LNG. Bottom line: This administration's war on U.S. energy will not do a thing to help the environment but will hurt freedom and prosperity here and abroad. We should accept this amendment. This amendment should be agreed to across the spectrum because it is good for American oil and gas. It is good for the world. It will actually help drive down CO2 while making our country stronger and helping us push back on Russia in the process. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I frankly don't understand the purpose of this amendment. Last spring, FERC issued an updated policy statement, an interim guidance, detailing how the Commission should treat new applications for natural gas pipelines and account for greenhouse gas emissions. The Commission, a month later, clarified that both documents were drafts and that it would seek further input and comments on the drafts. That is it. These documents are not final rules or orders from the Commission. They are not law. They are a draft, draft documents that the Commission has put out to solicit industry and stakeholder feedback, and that is the way we want the government to work for it to be responsive. Withdrawing these documents from draft status, which is what I think the gentleman's amendment would do, would have no impact on any policy and, instead, I think, would just create further confusion and possibly release FERC from the duty to consider industry's comments on the draft. It may be that the real reason that the Republicans offered this amendment is that they don't think that FERC should consider greenhouse gas emissions. They don't think that these emissions should matter when FERC makes a decision about whether or not to authorize a new natural gas pipeline. This doesn't change the law. The law currently requires FERC to consider the greenhouse gas impacts of a certificate it grants. Multiple Federal court rulings have held that the agency must think about these issues based on the statute, and the interim policy statement was meant to create certainty for industry on how the Commission would do that. Instead, Republicans want to send FERC and, frankly, all parts of the Federal Government back into confusion. If you want to say that FERC shouldn't consider greenhouse gases--I am not in favor of that--you should amend the statute to say that. By simply saying that these draft rules should be withdrawn, that is going to tell industry, how do you deal with this? How are they going to know what to do if there are no rules, no policy, no input from them whatsoever? I think it would be wrong to change the statute to say that they shouldn't take greenhouse gas impacts into consideration, but that is not what this amendment does. This amendment says to just get rid of these drafts, and then industry would have no input into any of this. I don't think industry would support that. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

Through American ingenuity and technical innovations, we now have the ability to explore these natural resources and return the United States to its status as a net exporter of oil and natural gas. Frankly, Mr. Speaker, there are so many excessive regulations, we may need to limit the number of pages in this report we are asking for. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.",
              "I rise in support of this amendment. This amendment requires the EPA Administrator and the Secretary of Energy to issue a report on harmful regulations that degrade our energy independence and raise costs for consumers. It requires the Biden administration take a hard look at how their own policies are hurting American consumers with high prices and less energy reliability. The Biden administration has imposed harmful energy policies on American consumers since day one, such as canceling the Keystone XL pipeline and imposing a moratorium on oil and gas extraction on Federal lands. We need to expand our American energy and our production, and I support this amendment.",
              "plain and simple, plain and simple, this amendment is unnecessary and misguided and, not to mention, oh, it strikes the whole bill. Maybe a lesson is needed for our friends across the aisle. The United States is the world's largest energy producer, in case y'all didn't know that; and combined with our allies, Canada and Mexico, North America is the world's largest energy superpower. Our network of pipelines, production platforms, and refineries span our borders, providing the American people with energy security that is absolutely unmatched around the world. Let me repeat that: Absolutely unmatched around the world. Our refineries along the Gulf Coast, which I have the third upper part of the Gulf Coast in the State of Texas, are the most complex and technically advanced in the entire world, bar none. We take crude oil of all grades from around the world and make valuable fuels and refined products that actually drive our entire economy. This amendment would cut off a valuable source of energy, just like when President Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline. I think I heard them say that they were about helping American workers, and how many jobs were lost when he canceled the Keystone pipeline. For that reason, Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment because it will make America less energy secure, the exact opposite purpose of H.R. 21, the bill before us. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

We need to move forward, and we need to encourage, as we do in the Inflation Reduction Act, offshore wind and use of renewables around the country. Mr. Speaker, for that reason, I oppose the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "major components of wind infrastructure are imported from our enemies like China. We have seen how poorly President Biden has handled the energy crisis, and to make it worse, he is outsourcing our energy to foreign adversaries. This threatens our national security, throws away American jobs, and increases our dependence on foreign energy. Regardless of the energy source, we need to prioritize our domestic supply chain and support American energy independence. American energy should come from America, not China--U.S. materials, U.S. jobs, U.S. energy independence. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",

We have seen positive growth in wind energy and we hope to see it evolve into a subsector of American energy exports one day. To achieve this goal, we need to promote the development of a strong domestic supply chain for wind infrastructure. This amendment is a constructive step in that direction and expresses the sense of Congress that we should develop our own domestic supply chains rather than import critical components from China. This amendment aims to prioritize the development of related industries through port upgrades, cable manufacturing, and hiring of vessels and crews for wind energy operations in the United States. By promoting domestic production and expanding our supply chain, we can create jobs, enhance our energy security, and strengthen our economy. Representative Luna's amendment will not only support our energy goals but also promote economic prosperity. I support this amendment as this policy is a positive step toward the development of a strong and secure domestic supply chain for wind infrastructure.

              "I believe I have made it very clear that this bill is deeply flawed from the concept to execution. While I really do hesitate to improve a bad bill, I think it is important that we acknowledge one of the bill's starkest omissions. My amendment would simply require that while developing the plan this bill proposes, the relevant Secretaries also develop a plan to consult with Tribal Governments. This is particularly important as the bill could open up an additional 300 million acres of new oil and gas extraction on public lands. If we really intend to give away an area three times the size of California to Big Oil, then we need to understand the impact it will have on communities across the West starting with those who have stewarded these lands since time immemorial. It is essential that the Secretaries fully and meaningfully consult with Tribal Governments to understand the impact this extractive development would have on Tribal communities from damaging air and water to destroying sacred sites. For too long, Tribal Governments have been excluded from Federal decisionmaking processes. We have seen the impact of that omission as homelands are degraded, sacred sites destroyed, and Tribal communities are forced to bear the brunt of pollution. A no more important example is the example of uranium contamination that continues and the cleanup of uranium contamination that continues in around the Grand Canyon and Navajo Nation, and that has affected that community and the Navajo people for generations. It is unacceptable that we would turn a blind eye to these impacts. Tribal Governments need to be at the table from the start helping to shape decisions that impact their communities and their ancestral lands. This amendment would ensure that they do just that while helping to uphold the Federal Government's trust responsibility. This shouldn't be controversial. In fact, this should have been built in from the start. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment requires local units of the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Forest Service to open job positions related to permitting or natural resources, including at local high schools, community colleges, universities, and other institutions. Mr. Speaker, I just have to commend the gentlewoman's district. I was recently in the town of Hobbs, New Mexico, and I got to visit an amazing facility called CTECH that is used to educate future workers in that area. I have seen a lot of career and technical education facilities, and this one is second to none. It was funded by the industry in the oil and gas business. They gave back to the community and built this remarkable facility. I believe they said over 1,000 high school students per year are using this facility. These are the places that are educating these future workers, and these jobs should be advertised there. We have heard from multiple sectors, including in the energy, mining, and renewable energy spaces, about the permitting challenges they face, and those challenges are magnified by a lack of sufficient qualified personnel in State and local land management offices. This amendment tasks the administration with performing outreach to local schools and other institutions to help fill open positions in their local offices. While it is far from a total solution to the permitting challenges in our country, this amendment could help improve permitting backlogs and provide employment opportunities at the local level, including in rural areas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I appreciate the opportunity to debate and consider my amendment to encourage local hiring and recruitment, but I also want to note my disappointment that my friends across the aisle rejected any consideration of my other two amendments on this floor. One of those amendments would allow the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to prevent exploratory mining from taking place on Federal land if it would negatively impact our water, farmers, Tribes, or local communities. In New Mexico, ``agua es vida''; ``water is life.'' It shouldn't be controversial to protect our waters from mining contamination for our people, farmers, and environment. My other amendment would have simply stated that this bill would not go into effect until the Federal Government certified that it would lower costs for American consumers and save taxpayers money. If this bill is really designed to lower energy costs for American consumers and taxpayers, let's verify that before putting polluters over people. Again, I appreciate the opportunity to consider my amendment, which would require local units of the Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, and National Park Service to conduct an outreach plan to disseminate and advertise local civil service positions with functions relating to permitting and natural resources in their offices. Each plan must include outreach to local high schools, community colleges, institutions of higher education, and other relevant institutions. The BLM, the Forest Service, and the National Park Service field offices, and ranger districts and sites are stewards of our lands and waters, but they also operate within communities within which they are located, whether it is Cuba or Farmington or Roswell, New Mexico. Adequate staffing at these offices and their headquarters, and our Federal agencies more broadly, is critical to our ability to effectively steward our natural resources and environment and move projects through the permitting process efficiently, responsibly, and with an ear tuned in to what the local communities need. Unfortunately, we are seeing many of our agencies struggle to fill vacancies and staff up. For example, an E&E News article from last year said there are vacancy counts for all BLM State offices; the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho; the Bureau's National Operations Center in Denver; and the other directorates. To be clear, I know BLM and other Federal agencies are working hard to address these challenges. My amendment would take another step to help address the staffing challenges by making sure local offices are communicating with the local communities about open positions. Whether it is New Mexico Highlands University, Eastern New Mexico University, or Navajo Tech, I believe we should be taking advantage of talent in the communities where these offices are located. To be clear, once again, we must also provide our Federal agencies with the resources and tools they need and support our Federal workforce along the way. The investments made last Congress to increase capacity at our Federal permitting offices were a downpayment, but we need to continue to invest in agency capability. Again, this amendment simply makes sure that our local agencies are thinking about communicating with our local talent when trying to fill those hiring challenges. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time."

The commission oversees drinking water quality for the Delaware River Watershed, a vitally important role that impacts millions of people across four States. Congress created the commission over 60 years ago and gave it powers to regulate the Delaware River Watershed. Crucially, each State's democratically elected leaders signed up to join the commission, and each State receives a vote on the commission. Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, the commission banned fracking in its watershed, and this wasn't a controversial decision. In fact, it was unanimous. It was a 4-0 vote to help protect the public health of the 13 million citizens in the watershed and to preserve the waters themselves. Today, Republicans want to retroactively take away the rights of the citizens of these four States and their elected representatives. They want to take away the powers that Congress gave the commission just because they don't like the outcome. I would suggest this: If you really care about clean rivers and waters, I urge you to oppose this amendment. If you care about people's rights to safe drinking water, I urge you to oppose this amendment.

My commonsense amendment would prevent additional leases for drilling on Federal lands on the Outer Continental Shelf. Fossil fuel companies can currently access public lands and waters to help secure our Nation's energy independence and reduce energy costs for hardworking American families. Yet, even as Americans faced high gas prices in 2022, oil companies failed to use thousands of existing permits for millions of acres that they had already leased. Currently, oil companies are sitting on more than 2,000 active leases covering 12 million acres of Federal waters. Mr. Speaker, 75 percent of these leases aren't being used. We should use existing leases, rather than increasing threats to our coasts, including the beautiful coast in my State of North Carolina. That is why my commonsense amendment seeks to protect our Nation's shores, public waters, and marine life. Thirty states have shorelines, and millions of Americans rely on clean beaches and clean oceans for countless jobs, nutritious food, and much-loved recreation. In closing, I encourage all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this reasonable, commonsense amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment would ban leasing for offshore oil and gas drilling off the northern California coast. Offshore drilling poses unacceptable risks. Where you drill, you spill. That is why Republican and Democratic Governors on both the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts have voiced their opposition to any new oil and gas leasing off their coasts. We should not put our oceans, fisheries, coastal communities, economies, and planet at risk just to enrich the fossil fuel industry. While folks were hurting at the pump, Big Oil companies were raking in record profits, and they were sitting on millions of acres of unused leases, capitalizing on the war in Ukraine in order to gouge U.S. consumers. Giving them even more control over our public lands is not necessary, and it won't do a darn thing for consumers. At a time when the climate crisis is ravaging communities across the globe, adding new leases on public lands makes no sense unless you value Big Oil profits above making sure our children have a livable planet. Now, the north coast of California is an amazing, pristine place that I am privileged to represent. It supports a thriving blue economy, including fishing, tourism, and some of the other values that we have heard discussed here today. It deserves the same kind of protection that President Trump gave reluctantly and very selectively to certain communities in Florida and on the East Coast after there was a backlash from Republican Members of Congress and Republican Governors to his drill everywhere plan. The north coast of California deserves at least that same level of protection, and by passing this amendment, it will get it. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, the gentleman from my neighboring district, Congressman Mike Thompson, for joining me on this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson).",
              "I rise in strong support of my amendment to H.R. 21. This amendment would ensure that the Federal Government is not forced into leasing public lands with low- or no-potential for oil and gas development to the fossil fuel industry as a result of this bill. The reckless leasing of low- to no-potential lands, also known as speculative leasing, has allowed millions of acres of our Nation's invaluable public lands to be put in harm's way for no real economic benefit in return. The problem is pervasive, affecting all Western States. However, it is particularly severe in my home State of Nevada where there are very few productive oil and gas formations but plenty of Federal land. Speculative leasing is a serious problem that costs taxpayers serious money. These leases are cheap. They are easy to acquire, usually selling at near the minimum bid of $2 per acre. Because they are so cheap, companies with purely speculative interests target these lands with little intent or likelihood of putting them into production. Thus, the government is then forced to use taxpayer dollars to administer and monitor them, but the leases almost never generate royalties or other benefits for the American taxpayer. In fact, according to the GAO, 99 percent of these noncompetitive leases, which are frequently issued with little or no-potential lands, never went into production or generated royalties for taxpayers. In addition to burdening taxpayers, these leases also come with environmental risks. In many instances, low-potential lands receive fewer protections than areas with high potential because Federal land managers forecast low likelihood of development activity. This leaves land, water, and wildlife all incredibly vulnerable. The current policy creates an opportunity cost. Once leased, low- potential lands are not prioritized for other uses like conservation and recreation, regardless of their development status. My amendment will prevent speculative leasing from becoming an even bigger problem. It will exclude Federal lands with no or low potential for oil and gas development from the scope of this bill. My amendment will save taxpayer dollars instead of strong-arming Federal agencies into spending those tax dollars on issuing and administering speculative leases that generate little or no revenue. This means the Federal oil and gas program can more efficiently focus on managing leases that actually generate royalties and revenues for taxpayers. My amendment will mitigate environmental risk. Nearly 50 percent of all leases in the West--spanning 9.9 million acres--are currently idle, with iconic landscapes they encompass frequently left neglected, and the unique cultural and natural resources of these storied places, likewise, are left largely unprotected. This amendment will prevent additional acreage from being put in environmental jeopardy to satisfy leases that half the time are simply left to gather dust. On balance, this amendment reins in the practice that has numerous costs and provides little or no return on investment for us, the American taxpayers. So I implore all of you, Democrats and Republicans, to vote ``yes'' on my amendment, a clear example of commonsense land management and fiscal responsibility. I yield back the balance of my time."

              "In closing, let me just say that this is the second bill that came up today dealing with gas stoves. If there is one message that I really want to give to my colleagues, and urge them to vote against this bill, as well as the previous one, is that we are not banning gas stoves. I don't know how many times I can say that. The administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Department of Energy, all of them had made clear over and over again that we are not banning gas stoves. What we are doing in this case with this bill is to try to provide more energy efficiency, which has been something that the Department of Energy has done for years. We have given them the authority and urged them to deal with and come up with more efficient appliances, whether it is gas stoves, electric stoves, cooktops, whatever it happens to be. So why not let them do that? Why keep saying that we are banning gas stoves when we are not? Why keep suggesting that somehow eliminating the Department of Energy's ability to adopt more efficiency standards for these appliances is not a good thing? It saves money. It makes sense. I heard my colleagues on the other side talk about the middle class, about working people. Working people want to save money. They want more efficiency. Overwhelmingly, polls show that they believe that appliances should be more efficient. I think that when people buy things and go to the appliance store or to the supermarket, or wherever they are buying appliances, they not only expect that those appliances are safe and safe for themselves and for their kids, but they also think that the Federal Government is trying to do things to make things more efficient. There is no reason why we shouldn't. For those reasons, I would ask my colleagues to vote to oppose this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I can't even believe we are at this moment where the administration wants to take your gas stove--not take your gas stove but limit what you can purchase in the future. I rise in support of H.R. 1640, the Save Our Gas Stoves Act. It is no secret this administration has waged war on American energy. From day one, President Biden has waged war on American energy, doing everything possible to phase out the use of all fossil fuels, including American-produced oil and clean-burning, American-produced natural gas. Now, they are taking it a step further. They are dictating what appliances Americans can purchase for their homes. In February, the Department of Energy announced a new proposal that would ban most natural-gas-fueled stoves on the market today. According to DOE's evaluation, only 4 percent of the gas stove cooking tops tested would meet DOE's proposed standard. DOE's proposed regulation would render gas stoves almost completely unavailable to the American consumer. The average annual savings under the proposed rule would be only about $1 over the average lifetime of the appliance--$1 a year. We are debating a proposed rule that would save Americans, on average, $1 a year over the life of the appliance? Mr. Speaker, we have a lot more to do in this United States Congress than debating a proposed rule that will limit Americans' choices for appliances that would only save them $1 a year. This clearly does not achieve the significant savings of energy as the law, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, requires. So, what is this all about? I will tell you what it is about, Mr. Speaker. The Democrats and this administration hate fossil fuels, and they want to diminish Americans' standard of living. This rule is illegal, and it should be withdrawn. It is not a sincere effort to improve efficiency but rather a part of the whole-of- government approach to target energy sources they ideologically oppose. H.R. 1640, the Save Our Gas Stoves Act, which we are debating today, would prohibit the Secretary of Energy from finalizing, implementing, or enforcing the recently proposed rule. It would also prohibit the Department of Energy from reissuing a rule that bans the use of natural gas. Their goal is to end natural gas in this country. Natural gas is what got us down to the carbon emissions levels that we have achieved. If you want to approach it from the climate change standpoint, the carbon emissions standpoint has been because of natural gas. It would also prohibit the Department of Energy from reissuing a rule. It would clarify that DOE does not have the authority to remove cooking products from the market simply because of the fuel product that the appliance consumes. I am a proud cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation, and I thank Congresswoman Lesko for her leadership on this and for introducing this bill. Americans should be free to choose the cooking products they use in their homes and their businesses, and this bill ensures that. Households that use natural gas for heating, cooking, and clothes drying save an average of $1,068 per year compared to homes that use electricity for those appliances. The rush to green and mass electrification efforts pursued by the Biden administration are costing Americans and making everyday life more expensive, all for $1 per year savings. It is gas stoves today. It will be gas furnaces tomorrow. They are already talking about gas hot water heaters and then dryers. They are coming after your natural gas appliances because they hate natural gas. The bottom line is that, on day one, President Biden said that we are going to end the use of fossil fuels. He wanted to ban fracking, offshore production, and onshore production. That is the real reason we are debating this. It is not about the appliance. It is about the war on energy and American-produced energy. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that is in front of us today which prioritizes American energy affordability and reliability and that puts the American people first and gives them choices. Let the market determine which choice they can have, and let the consumer choose which one best meets their needs for their family, for their households, and for their businesses as they look at the bottom line in their budgets because the intention of the proposed rule only saves American families $1 a year. Give me a break. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1640.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1640, the so-called Save Our Gas Stoves Act. This is a Republican messaging bill designed to deliberately mislead the American people about gas stoves. Let's set the record straight with a little reality. The Biden administration is not, and I repeat, not banning gas stoves. This is nothing but a political stunt. House Republicans continue to put politics over people. With this bill today, they are once again putting polluters over people. H.R. 1640 is designed to prevent the Department of Energy from finalizing a recently proposed energy efficiency standard for electric and gas stoves and cooktops that would lower energy bills, improve Americans' health, and cut pollution. DOE energy efficiency standards are extremely popular. A recent poll found that three out of five Americans support stricter energy efficiency standards for appliances and buildings. The proposed DOE rule that Republicans are trying to prevent from moving forward is a commonsense standard. The claim that 96 percent of gas stoves on the market don't meet the proposed DOE standard is just not true. Mr. Speaker, 50 percent of the market already meets the proposed standard, including all entry-level models. More importantly, the proposed standard only applies to new gas stoves manufactured and sold 3 years after the rule is finalized. That would give manufacturers more than enough time to meet these new standards. There is simply no reason for this proposed rule to be controversial. No one is saying you can't keep your gas stove. No one is saying you don't have a choice. No one is saying you have to move to electric stoves. This is all misinformation. Rather than acknowledging the facts, Republicans are instead employing their usual scare tactics, putting politics over people. Despite what you hear from my Republican colleagues today, the DOE rule does not ban gas stoves, does not remove gas stoves from homes, and does not prevent anyone from putting a gas stove in their home. This rule only applies to new stoves, and, as I said, manufacturers have 3 years to meet the standard. Mr. Speaker, I am sorry I have to keep repeating it, but I know the other side keeps repeating the misinformation. All this means is that if a consumer goes to buy a new gas stove in 3 years, it will be more energy efficient and cheaper to operate. That is a win for consumers, our health, and our ongoing fight to combat the worsening climate crisis. Mr. Speaker, to make it worse, Republicans are not just going after this energy efficiency standard. Since the bill does not include a sunset clause, it could forever limit the Department of Energy from taking substantive action to improve energy efficiency of cooktops. This is just another way Republicans are continuing to prop up their polluter friends. This bill as well as the REINS Act, which is on the floor later this evening, show that Republicans are skeptical of everything agencies do, including all rulemakings and regulations. Republicans think that they can do the math, conduct the analysis, and reach conclusions better than the subject matter experts at our Federal agencies. That is not how our government works. We hire agency experts to make the best decisions and do their jobs best. The Department of Energy rulemaking process is detailed and well researched, with ample opportunity for public engagement. Commonsense energy efficiency standards save everyday Americans money and reduce emissions. These standards are popular, and cooktops that meet the standard are already available on the market. Republicans claim to care about energy prices, but this Republican bill prohibits the Department of Energy from finalizing a rule that can save consumers up to $1.7 billion. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1640 should be rejected so that the Department of Energy can proceed with its commonsense energy efficiency standards. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the balance of my time."

              "I stand here before you today because the American people are hurting. Over the past few years, they have been forced to cope with skyrocketing costs, a direct result of President Biden's misguided energy policies. With every step the President has taken to restrict domestic energy, from canceling the Keystone pipeline to placing a ban on new drilling, it has become much harder for Americans to make ends meet. Fortunately, Republicans have a solution to this problem that will increase domestic energy production. The United States is home to some of the largest reserves of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. The Lower Energy Costs Act will allow us to tap into these resources so we can drive down the cost of energy and combat the out-of-control inflation that has devastated the American family. Our legislation will increase American energy production, reform our broken permitting process, reverse President Biden's anti-energy policies, and improve the construction of energy infrastructure. H.R. 1 also protects our energy future by boosting production of critical minerals, making us less reliant on our adversaries such as China. Under the leadership of Chair Rodgers, my colleagues and I on the Energy and Commerce Committee have been working to shape policies that will unleash American energy and lower costs for our families. H.R. 1 represents our commitment to fighting for an economy that is strong and a nation that is safe. This bill will help reduce our reliance on foreign oil, which would not only benefit our economy but also strengthen our national security and our safety. The left's dream of a Green New Deal future has turned into a nightmare, and it is time for the President to wake up. With prices nearing record highs, the need to unleash American energy has never been more pressing and important. This body must take immediate action to lower energy costs, fight inflation, and secure our energy future, and this bill will do it. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act.",
              "I am here today to voice my strong opposition to H.R. 1--because it will not and never could lower energy costs, and it is not taking the long view of where this Nation must go to reach true energy independence. Too often when policy makers talk about energy there are too many sound bites and not enough balanced common-sense approaches to our Nation's energy future. The economy and energy consumption are critically linked to each other because economic activity requires energy consumption. We all know that the booming economy under President Biden has led to energy demand increases and that the war in Ukraine although far from our shores has impacted global energy supply and as a consequence the price of energy. President Biden took decisive action that has led to the sixth consecutive month of reductions in inflation across the entire economy and includes prices at gas pumps. Democrats who took decisive action in the 117th Congress to take control of United States' energy future made major investments in renewable energy that is creating jobs, lowering the cost of energy and putting American consumers first. The oil and gas industries fueled the economic growth and global success of the United States in the last century and without a doubt bolstered the economy that created the largest middle class in our Nation's history. Oil and gas today and into the near future will continue to play an important role in the Nation's strategic and economic interest well into this century. It is important to note that some of the big wins from the Inflation Reduction Law will be the oil and gas industries, which has made significant investments in renewable energy already. It is a simple fact that the owners and operators of the energy delivery infrastructure in the United States--the pipelines, electric power grids, and gasoline distribution hubs that supply energy to an overwhelming majority of homes and businesses in the United States is not going to change anytime soon. The Inflation Reduction Law included multiple oil and gas leasing reforms to reflect today's pursuit of offshore oil and gas exploration while at the same time incentivizing the pursuit of wind and solar by the oil and gas industry. The Inflation Reduction Law will issue in the Energy Age that will bridge the gap between the old and the new forms of energy that will continue to fuel the American economy. This is not nor should it be viewed a war against the old and new forms of energy but a bridge that will allow a smooth transition to the many facets of energy provision that will mean prosperity and jobs, while providing low-cost affordable energy for all people. My greatest concern is that H.R. 1, if it becomes law, would roll back, important reforms by lowering royalty rates, repealing interest fees, and reinstating noncompetitive leasing. H.R. 1 rubber-stamps the construction of new natural gas pipelines-- which is already frighteningly easy--while shutting every agency, apart from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, out of the review process. Natural gas is a viable and important component of energy security for the United States, but its extraction, processing, and delivery to consumers does come with risks. Natural gas in its raw form is odorless and colorless--an odor is added so that people can detect its presence and respond to the threat before it is too late. It is important that safeguards remain in place regarding exploration to protect gas field workers and people who may be in the vicinity of exploration activities. H.R. 1, also poses risks to the United States strategic interest because it removes the requirement that Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exports be determined to be in the public interest before being sent overseas, tearing down guardrails that prevent our adversaries from purchasing more of our energy to use against us. H.R. 1 poses risks to our national parks and public treasures because it would bypass the local and public interest in national lands by allowing oil and gas lease sales even if there is no national interest to support approval of the sale of mineral leases on these lands. The sale of leases on land that is owned by the American people should solely be in the interest of the people of the United States and this can be determined by identifying that there are no nonpublic sources of oil and gas to meet demand. The Nation is on the road toward a smooth transition to other forms of energy to complement its use of oil and gas that will result in a balance of energy options for a more stable, more affordable, and reliable energy supply. The Nation's current mining law is over 150 years old and does need updating, but it should be done so with all stakeholders at the table with a win-win approach. H.R. 1 makes this dangerous status quo worse. H.R. 1 allows mining on public land and the dumping of toxic mining waste as the ``highest and best use'' of those lands, which means the lands will not be suitable for a return to public use without a significant investment by taxpayers to cleanup and restore it to a natural state. I am not saying that all mining or exploration companies will follow the letter of the law--in H.R. 1 should it become law, but if only a few mining leases leave mining waste on public land and are so reckless as to not restore land to its original state the damage would be significant. H.R. 1 would also allow extraction of valuable minerals without paying the owners of the land--the American people in strict violation of every principle of oil and gas leasing. Private property owners who lease for oil and gas exploration expect to be compensated for the lease of their land--the American taxpayer should not expect any less from the lease of their public land held by the Federal government. Letting mining companies continue to extract valuable minerals from public lands without paying anything to the American people is establishing a dangerous precedent for private landowners with minerals, oil, or gas--one that I am sure the people in Texas, Alaska and other high exploration states would take offense over. To date, mining companies--many of which are foreign-owned--have already extracted an estimated $300 billion in minerals from public lands and caused untold damage, without paying a single dime to American taxpayers. H.R. 1 does nothing to improve tribal consultation, even though the vast majority of minerals needed for clean energy are located within 35 miles of tribal lands. The Nation is in the process of transitioning from primary relying on oil and as as a source of energy to alternative sources. The transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy sources will depend heavily on the adoption of critical minerals. Our Nation's clean energy transition will require new minerals, but mining must not come at the cost of our health, our environment, or our special places. I am very committed to--making sure that the emergence and adoption of new energy sources does not leave environmental victims along the way. I am aware of one company, Critical Mineral Refining (CMR) of Houston Texas, that has made environmentally sound extraction, transporting and mining of critical minerals its core mission. CMR's process has been certified by the Environmental Protection Agency as environmentally nuetral technology--which means that there is no harm to the water, soil, or air. Today, as we work to bring new forms of energy to the marketplace and because there are technologies that are cleaner and safer to conduct energy extraction, transportation, and refining these approaches should be adopted as industry standards. The application of this knowledge to critical minerals will prevent sickness, accidents, and deaths due to antiquated approaches to mining and refining being applied to rare earth minerals that are needed in solar and wind energy production. The extraction, transport, and refining of critical minerals could increase sixfold by 2050, according to one scenario by the International Energy Agency. Industries, consumers, and the nation needs to prepare for the boom that is coming from the emergence of critical minerals into the marketplace. By value this market could surpass $400 billion, exceeding the value of all of the coal extracted in 2020. We must reform our outdated mining system to raise the bar for mining both in the U.S. and across the globe in preparation for this new entrant into the energy marketplace. Helping critical minerals emerge and guarding its orderly introduction into our commercial sectors is a major objective of the United States to minimize externalities that often accompany extraction-based enterprises that too often rely upon complex global supply chains. The city of Houston--through Hurricane Harvey's flood waters, Winter Storm Uri's electric grid failures, and other climatic events has experienced the early effects of the climate crisis. Critical infrastructure like the electric grid and water systems must be resilient enough to withstand extreme weather events. This is only the beginning, but it is not too late to get the nation and the economy on the right track to combat the most potent threat to our national economy--climate related weather changes. Climate related weather change cost the U.S. $169.8 billion last year--a $14 billion increase from 2021 and a $55 billion increase from 2020. All the data shows us that the climate crisis is worsening. If Republicans cared about the economy as much as they claim, they would invest in science-based, clean energy solutions. Rolling back of the IRA will have severe consequences, costing the U.S. trillions in economic growth and hundreds of thousands of dollars in jobs. Climate related weather change is the culprit of natural disasters across the U.S. that have killed nearly 3,800 people and caused significant structural damage. In 2022, U.S. wildfires caused by extreme drought and rising temperatures burned a record number of acres and surpassed the 10-year average. Last week, a new UN report found that the world will be unable to limit global wanning by 1.5 degrees Celsius by the early 2030's. The report also found that global average temperatures could warm by 3.2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century causing seven feet of sea level rise by the end do the century. Clean energy, joining the contribution of legacy energy sources, is the future for our workforce sector. Despite fossil fuel production rising by 33 percent since 2014, employment in the fossil fuel industry has declined 34 percent since 2014. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, House Democrats are creating nearly 360,000 jobs by the end of this year and 660,000 jobs by the end of 2025. H.R. 1 masquerades as ``energy security'' when in reality it only sets the stage for actions by less responsible oil and gas energy providers to put at risk communities that may face higher risks for chemical disasters, more toxic air, more unsafe drinking water, and substantially weaker environmental and public health protections. The bill also blocks lawsuits from anyone who did not participate in public comment periods (which are also shortened by the bill). H.R. 1 is drafted so broadly that it exempts all so-called ``critical energy resource'' facilities--such as petroleum refineries that release air toxics like benzene and use hydrofluoric acid linked to catastrophic chemical disasters--from commonsense Clean Air Act and hazardous waste permitting requirements. It also shamelessly grants these facilities amnesty for any violations of federal, state, or local environmental law. H.R. 1 completely erodes the new chemicals review process under the bipartisan Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), allowing new chemicals--even PFAS--on the market without any consideration of safety. Chemicals in the wrong hands can be weapons that are used to wreak havoc in unsuspecting communities, which can pose threats to homeland security. Because of these concerns both Republicans and Democrats joined efforts to pass the bipartisan basis in the 2016 TSCA reform law. The only ``permitting reform'' in H.R. 1 is the gutting of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a bulwark within federal law governing agency regulations of activities that directly impact people to provide meaningful oversight of processes that pose risks to life, health, safety, community welfare and vulnerable persons that include children, the elderly, the disabled and minorities. As industry representatives have already said, this attack on NEPA will not help accelerate the energy projects we need; less than 1 percent of projects even go through NEPA's full, detailed environmental review. One important point to note to people on both sides of the debate-- major oil and gas producers do not hate all regulations--they depend on regulations to keep bad actors and poor command and control processes from putting the environment or communities at risk. Every time there is an accident involving oil, gas, or chemical processes it puts every company and refiner under the spotlight regardless of the work that has been done and continues to be done to get the job right for the environment, workers, and communities. H.R. 1 weakens enforcement of nearly all environmental and public health laws by dramatically limiting the statute of limitations for unlawful permit decisions--like those required by the Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act--to 120 days. Limiting public comment is stopping communities from learning about and communicating their views on government permitting activity--that would like result in actions not in the public interest. Federal regulatory process delays are caused by a lack of agency resources and staff capacity. Fortunately, Democrats already passed more than $1 billion in the IRA for federal agency permitting offices, which will address this issue and is expected to drastically shrink the timelines for permitting. H.R. 1 codifies the reckless, extreme Trump-era NEPA regulations, which were widely opposed by House Democrats, into law. These changes prohibit agencies from properly considering climate change and the cumulative impacts of multiple sources of pollution in permitting decisions, among other bad provisions. H.R. 1 arbitrarily shortens public comment periods for environmental reviews under NEPA and even allows polluters to conduct their own reviews, creating an obvious conflict of interest. It also requires that these reviews ``meet the goals of the [project] applicant,'' instead of the public's interest. Outside of NEPA, H.R. 1 allows the owners and operators of ``critical energy recourse facilities'' to bypass public health and environmental safety standards built into the permitting process, directly endangering the safety of the workers and communities near these facilities. H.R. 1 also undermines Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which empowers states and Tribes to holistically protect their lakes, rivers, streams, and other bodies of water from development. Native people have and continue to be guardian of the land, water, and air whose rights on tribal land must be respected. Energy independence is within our grasp--and so is cleaner, water, air, and soil. We should not treat the environment or people as if they are expendable. To meet this challenge of energy independence, we must stay the course of the Inflation Reduction Law and move ahead in modernizing and increasing the capacity of federal permitting offices, and reform the transmission planning and cost allocation process.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act. My goal as the chair of Energy and Commerce Committee is to make sure Americans have access to affordable, reliable energy. This was a key promise in the House Republicans' ``Commitment to America,'' and we are hitting the ground running to deliver on that promise. This is just the beginning. Energy is foundational to everything. For centuries it has driven human progress and development. It is why America has done more to lift people out of poverty and raise the standard of living than anywhere else in the world. Today, over 3.7 billion people are living in energy poverty. That is half the world. They have a 10-year lower life expectancy, 35 percent fewer years of education, and many don't have electricity at all. Here in the United States of America, we are blessed with the ability and the resources to continue to raise the standard of living globally and even lift people out of poverty. Our goal today is to celebrate how our abundant energy resources have unleashed prosperity and invited people from around the world to come across the globe to America to achieve their hopes and dreams. We have accomplished this as a leader in reducing emissions and with the highest environmental and labor standards in the world. We cannot afford to move backward with a reckless command-and-control so-called climate agenda that forces people to pay more and go without reliable electricity. H.R. 1 prioritizes the American people over this radical climate agenda. On his first day in office, President Biden started a war on American energy. Predictably, gas prices skyrocketed to the highest levels in American history. President Biden revoked the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, imposed a moratorium on oil production on Federal lands, and directed agencies across the Federal Government to impose punitive and burdensome regulations. As the American people suffered, President Biden turned to OPEC and Russia to boost supplies. In the face of Russia's aggression, President Biden looked the other way and green-lit the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, emboldening Russia to attack Ukraine. The CCP now is deepening ties with Russia and consolidating its control over more than 90 percent of the world's critical mineral supplies. To win the future, we cannot allow our energy security to be surrendered to our adversaries. H.R. 1 sends the strong and unmistakable signal to restore American energy dominance and bolster our national security. H.R. 1 will unleash American energy, lower costs, and secure our supply chains. This package helps lift barriers to expanding our energy supplies, remove red tape for exporting and importing LNG, and build more pipelines with our North American allies and across the States. It would repeal President Biden's burdensome natural gas tax, which will harm communities, shut down production, and raise prices across the entire economy. H.R. 1 will encourage innovation and production of critical materials here at home to cut China out of our energy supply chains and ensure America is leading the world in innovation and next-generation energy technologies. We have heard a lot of talk, and Democrats are forcing a so-called transition that requires the American people to suffer through supply chains and price hikes. What Republicans are offering through H.R. 1 is a commitment to energy expansion that will deliver on lower costs and reliable and affordable energy. The fact is, higher costs are making life unaffordable for hardworking people in this country while forcing us to be dangerously reliant on Chinese supply chains that are dirtier and use slave labor. I think about the farmer who told us that this so-called climate agenda is raising the cost of food and making it harder for farmers to feed our families; an advocate who shared with our committee that record-high energy costs hurt low-income and minority families the most; and the mayor of Midland who told us her community is thriving because of the investment in jobs the oil and gas industry brings. We must embrace and expand America's position as the number one energy producer in the world while continuing our leadership to reduce emissions. People all over this Nation are counting on us for a better quality of life. With H.R. 1, we will boost energy production, lift regulatory burdens for the construction of more energy infrastructure, cut China out of our critical material supply chains, and lower costs across the board. This is how we build a more secure future for Americans. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 1, and I reserve the balance of my time."

              "I thank Chairwoman Rodgers for yielding me time. I rise in support of H.R. 21, an important and timely bill, and I am proud that the new Republican majority made this one of our first priorities. In less than 2 years, President Biden has drained our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, putting American energy security at risk. Thankfully, House Republicans have a plan to address the issue, replenish our reserve, and unleash American energy. The President's energy policies have hurt Americans, and I thank my colleague on the other side of the aisle. He is correct. In releasing oil from the SPR, it may have helped to lower gasoline prices; however, it uncloaked the lie that it was price gouging from oil companies that caused prices to rise to begin with. More supply was needed, that was obvious, and this administration's policies had constrained domestic production and supply. Approximately 40 percent of the SPR has been drawn down since President Biden took office, with no plan to replenish it. Instead of working together to address the issue, the President has, indeed, chosen to peddle a false narrative about our efforts. The President claims our bill, the Strategic Production Response Act, would limit the administration's access to the SPR. This is blatantly false. Our bill specifically reinforces a President's ability to tap the SPR if an energy emergency is declared. Our bill would, however, require the Department of Energy to prepare a plan to encourage domestic production if the SPR is tapped without a declared energy emergency. While we may accept the seriousness of climate change, we do not accept that U.S. energy transmission and restructuring of the entire industrial base is the solution. Energy security is national security, and failing to increase energy production and replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve puts our country at risk. We need to unleash American innovation and energy production and set our country on a path to energy independence. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 21.",
              "in that letter, Secretary Granholm wrote that by hamstringing the administration, this bill will result in ``more oil supply shortages in times of crisis and higher gasoline prices for Americans.'' The President also recognizes this bill is a bad deal for the American people, and that is why he said that he would veto it if it ever got to his desk. Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record the text of the Statement of Administration Policy. Statement of Administration Policy H.R. 21--Strategic Production Response Act--Rep. McMorris Rodgers, R-WA and 31 Cosponsors The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 21, the Strategic Production Response Act. The bill would significantly weaken a critical energy security tool, resulting in more oil supply shortages and higher gas prices for working families. This Administration's use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has been essential to protecting our energy security and to lowering gas prices for Americans. Following Putin's further invasion of Ukraine last year, President Biden authorized the largest-ever emergency release from the SPR, in coordination with historic releases from allies and partners. The results speak for themselves: today, gasoline prices are $1.60 per gallon lower than their peak this summer and below their pre-invasion levels. That was far from a foregone conclusion: the Treasury Department estimates that SPR actions reduced prices at the pump by as much as 40 cents per gallon. If enacted, H.R. 21 would significantly weaken America's ability to take such decisive action to increase supply and lower prices in times of crisis. Putin has tried to use energy supply and high prices as a strategy to weaken the United States and Europe's resolve to defend Ukraine. By interfering with the United States' ability to release, oil collectively, this legislation would help Putin's war aims. In addition, H.R. 21 would severely restrict the Administration's ability to increase oil supply and prevent price spikes in response to natural disasters or pipeline outages-as Administrations of both parties have done. By arbitrarily requiring completion of a report related to energy production on Federal lands, H.R. 21 makes it harder to provide relief to Americans during energy disruptions globally and at home. Moreover, there is nothing currently standing in the way of domestic oil production. Production is up by more than 1 million barrels per day under President Biden and is on track to reach a new record this year. Oil and gas companies are currently sitting on thousands of unused but approved permits that they can use to further increase production right now. Because H.R. 21 will jeopardize our energy security and increase gas prices for working families, the Administration strongly opposes the bill. If Congress were to pass this bill, the President would veto it.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 21, the Strategic Production Response Act. Two weeks ago, this body sent a strong message that we must ensure our Nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve will not advance the energy interests of China over the energy security interests of Americans. This bill today will help ensure this vital American energy asset and American security interests will not be drained away for nonemergency, political purposes. This bill is about restoring America's energy security. It provides a path towards making energy more affordable for Americans who are looking to us to help ease the pain at the pump. H.R. 21 does this by preserving the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for its vital and central purpose: to provide the oil supplies Americans need during true emergencies--emergencies like supply disruptions that threaten the Nation's economy, or the loss of oil production due to hurricanes and other disasters. Put simply, under this bill, if an administration chooses to use the reserve for nonemergency political purposes, it will first have to develop a plan that an equal amount would be reinstated from American energy resources. The SPR should be used as a tool of last resort. This is sensible energy policy. It is also urgent policy. At present, the SPR's ability to protect Americans has been put at risk. More than 250 million barrels of oil, approximately 40 percent of the reserve, has been drawn down in less than 2 years. This is more than all of the former Presidents in history combined. It is all to cover up historically high gas prices in an election year. This is irresponsible. The Biden administration has undermined our Nation's ability to respond to true energy emergencies by mismanaging our Nation's strategic energy stockpile. At the same time, the administration has taken every action to suppress America's mighty energy production abilities. Unbelievably, the Biden administration has turned to Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to pump more oil instead of working to lift their regulatory restraints on American energy producers. America's oil production and refining capacity remains 1 million barrels below peak levels during the prior administration. We have the world's most abundant resources and the capacity to produce millions more barrels per day. America should never be at the mercy of OPEC or Russia. Energy security is economic security and it is national security. It is all connected. It is foundational to everything. We should be unleashing American energy on all fronts. Don't forget, Mr. Speaker, the United States has some of the highest environmental and labor standards in the world. We have been the leader in bringing down carbon emissions. We did this by embracing innovation and our abundant natural resources, not by shutting down entire industries. Right now, America is suffering through the worst energy crisis in decades, and gas prices are still surging upwards. Now, President Biden's and the Democrats' radical rush-to-green agenda has made life unaffordable for people across the country. It has driven up inflation, it has strained household budgets, and it has weakened our electric grid. Gas prices have risen to the highest levels in history. Some have been forced to pay more than $6 a gallon. Gas prices are still 40 percent higher today, and diesel prices are up almost $2 a gallon more than when President Biden took office. It is time to flip the switch. It is time to end the politically motivated abuse of the SPR and focus on American energy and American security. Let's send a strong signal this Congress that we stand for energy security, preserving the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, restoring America's energy dominance, and providing for the prosperity of all Americans. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 21, and I reserve the balance of my time."

              "I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 1, House Republicans' polluters over people act. When the House Democratic majority passed the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, they delivered key environmental safeguards to bolster our clean energy economy and lower costs. The legislation that Republicans are bringing to the floor attempts to undermine those promising provisions because of political animus. Instead of trying to meet the needs of the American taxpayer, they are working to line the pockets of fossil fuel tycoons and exacerbate toxic mining projects that directly harm communities like mine. H.R. 1 is not about the people, it is about a political win, and it is hooey. This legislation would undo significant environmental regulations central to our public health and environmental protections at a time when people are facing an alarming pattern of severe weather, lack of access to clean water and air, and blatant pollution across the country. Pollution kills people. I can tell you that no one here is breathing dirty air. No one here is drinking dirty water. No one here is growing anything in dirty soil. If we are not, that means that no one else should be forced to do so. It would roll back the environmental review processes under NEPA, putting community health and safety at risk while worsening pollution and the health risks associated with toxic chemicals such as PFAS, the same forever chemicals that are killing our firefighters. I urge you to listen to the committee hearings where you will hear them say there is no need for community engagement, polluters can self- monitor. That is why I was so disappointed but, oh, not surprised when Republicans voted down my amendment to include an environmental analysis and review of how oil and gas development will impact community health and safety because it will. Instead, Republicans are so eager to rush into free-for-all oil and gas development that they are unable to reckon with the serious health consequences they are pawning off onto our constituents. You would have more respect for a bill if they cared enough about the health and safety of your community, if they wanted to protect your child or your grandmother's health. Unfortunately, we know that the Black community is disproportionately impacted by environmental pollution. I have talked about what is going on in my district every single week. Black Americans are three times more likely to die of asthma after continued exposure to polluted air, a result of historic, systemic racism. This legislation makes it virtually impossible for impacted communities to file lawsuits against corporate polluters for environmental and public health damages, so it is killing your lungs and silencing your voice. It continues to put mining rights ahead of the interests of the community, especially in indigenous communities where mining was used to settle the West. This bill declares that indigenous communities shouldn't even be consulted about what is going on on their lands, to rip away lands from indigenous communities in favor of our own traditional, patriarchal, American individualistic interests. Even more than that, we have seen ties between environmental racism and increased rates of gender violence at these mining sites where indigenous women and girls are attacked by employees at the man camps. Now they don't even care about the safety of women and girls. Polling shows that two-thirds of Americans want legislation that addresses the climate crisis, proving once again that Republicans answer to special interests and not the will of the people. This is all about dirty money, profits over people, and it is disgraceful. Shame on them, Mr. Speaker, for deliberately ignoring the health of our people and the environment. I oppose this bill and any other fossil fuel cash grabs the Republicans send our way.",
              "Throughout this debate, my Democratic colleagues have repeated misinformation and engaged in fearmongering as a tactic to convince American families to submit to their green agenda and just accept more expensive and less reliable energy as the new normal to undermine our economy, make the cost of living even higher, and, perhaps even more troubling, severely undermine our national security. Apparently, my Democratic colleagues are okay with making China great again at the expense of the American people and the rest of the world. I heard the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, my colleague--again, who I have great respect for--say a few minutes ago: Tell the American people the truth. Well, let's tell the American people some truth. According to a report by the LendingClub, at the end of 2022--that is 2 years into the Biden administration--9.3 million more United States consumers were living paycheck to paycheck compared to the prior year. Of that group, 75 percent identified inflation as a reason for their financial situation to be worsening. By the end of 2022, China's oil refining capacity exceeded the United States' oil refining capacity. According to the International Energy Agency's oil market report, U.S. refining capacity is at 17.6 million barrels per day. According to the China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Association, China's capacity is at 18.4 million barrels per day. We are far more dependent on China today for the very rare earth minerals and critical minerals that are needed to pursue the renewable green energy plan that the Democrats are trying to push. You can't get there in the timeframe that they are trying to get there, Mr. Speaker, without becoming more dependent on China. There are those who say that Republicans are climate deniers. That is simply not true. We simply believe that Republicans have better ideas to unleash America's energy and to restore America's energy independence. At the same time that those are good energy policies, they are also good climate policies. Let me give you an example. Everybody says that the goal of addressing the climate problem is to reduce carbon emissions. Mr. Speaker, if that is truly the goal, why do we not want to export more American natural gas around the world? According to the American Exploration and Production Council, if we would simply export four times the amount of natural gas that we are exporting today--which we could do easily because we have got a wealth of it--we could lower carbon emissions more than if we were to electrify every vehicle in America, put a solar panel and a battery backup on the home and the rooftop of every residential home in America, and build 57,000 industrial-strength windmills, all combined. American natural gas is the cleanest form of natural gas on the planet. Our friends and allies in Europe sure wish they had some of that today because they have become dependent on Vladimir Putin for their sources of energy. Look at the Germans, who decided to throttle their nuclear suite and become dependent on Russia for their energy. What did they end up doing? Forest clearing, burning wood to cook their food and heat their homes. We do not want to go the way of Europe. They have already tried all of this. I implore my Democratic colleagues: We are not arguing about the goal. We agree with cleaner forms of energy. What we are arguing about, it appears to me, is the timeframe in which to accomplish that and the amount of money and the change in the quality of life that it is going to require for the American people. I am sure many of you went to college and you studied the business triangle: time, cost, and quality. You can't affect one of those without affecting the other two. With this rush to green, if we want to do this so fast before renewable forms of energy are mature enough technologically to be able to provide the baseload energy for our grid, to put fuel in our automobiles, if we want to do it that fast, it is going to cost a hell of a lot of money, and it is going to change for the worse the quality of life for the American people. H.R. 1 is a commonsense energy package. If you lower energy costs, you are going to lower inflation. If you lower inflation, you are going to allow the American people to keep more of their hard-earned money. When American people keep their hard-earned money, they come up with good ideas, and our economy begins to thrive. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1 is not about politics. It is about the American people. They are sick and tired of people inside the beltway taking and taking and taking while they are always having to do the giving. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 1. It is the right thing to do for the American people. Let's unleash American energy. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I rise today to ensure that the American people and every single New Mexican back home in my home State knows exactly what this bill is all about. H.R. 1 is not a bill to cut costs and unlock American energy. H.R. 1 is a blatant giveaway of public lands, public waters, and public minerals to the highest bidder. It guts environmental laws, it opens oil and gas leasing to mining and multinational companies, and it will send our communities and our laws back to the 19th century--the 19th century--to 1847 specifically, when we opened the West through the hardrock mining law to minerals claims and multinational corporations, who took advantage of our communities, who dumped tailings piles into our rivers and our streams, and who strip-mined sacred and ancestral lands of our indigenous communities. That is right. This bill would take us back before the automobile was invented, before we had electricity, before women had the right to vote in this country, and before New Mexico even became a territory of the United States when our communities, lands, and waters were stripped away from them and given to the highest bidder. So let me be clear: This legislation is not about lowering costs. It is not about lessening the burden at the pump. It is not about lowering costs for our families. These are just talking points that have been provided by fossil fuel and mining companies and by their allies across the aisle who see the opportunity to strip away environmental regulations and vast amounts of public resources, lands, and waters for private profit. In fact, this bill will increase the deficit, robbing our communities of more than a century of hard-fought environmental wins to protect our lands and waters. That is why House Democrats have a clear message today: Not on our watch. Let's be clear and talk exactly about what this bill is and does. My friends, Mr. Speaker, on the other side of the aisle want to claim that this bill will create jobs, that more drilling and mining will lower costs, and that it is going to somehow magically solve our global critical mineral shortage. Let me be clear, as somebody whose parents worked in the energy industry. My father was a welder in the oil and gas fields; my mother, a crane mechanic at a coal-fired power plant. As somebody who spent over two decades of my career working on natural resources issues, let me say it loud and clear: We cannot mine and drill our way to solve these problems. In fact, this bill not only does not help our communities but puts our Nation and our planet at risk. Scientists from across the world released a report just last week that made clear that if we do not take significant action right now to curb global emissions, we will cross a global tipping point and catastrophic global climate change. This bill would threaten our global planetary health. In fact, this legislation, which the President has already said he would veto, would open vast swaths of our land and our water to oil and gas drilling, to mining, not to lower costs, but to line the pockets of wealthy oil companies. In the name of streamlining, it would gut environmental laws like the National Environmental Policy Act, a piece of bipartisan legislation that Richard Nixon signed; the Clean Water Act; the Clean Air Act. It would gut protections for our communities to be able to actually have a say in what happens in their own lands and waters. It would make it easier for large corporations to pollute and dump toxins without consequence. Finally, this legislation not only does not lower costs but raises the deficit by billions of dollars. So I ask the American people and I ask New Mexicans: Is this what you want Congress working on, a 175-page bill filled with thinly veiled corporate giveaways that gut our environmental laws, that cut our communities out, and that would line the pockets of private corporations? No. The American people want clean air. They want clean water. They want climate action. They want a planet that they can leave to their children. That is why Democrats and the President fought to pass the Inflation Reduction Act just a few months ago in this Chamber. That bill makes the largest investment in climate action ever in the history of this country and ever in the history of this planet. Our bill, the bill we passed to address the global climate crisis, will create millions of jobs. It will rebuild our infrastructure and our local economies. It will invest in our communities and the resilience of our ecosystems. It will reduce household costs like our friends across the aisle are trying to claim with this giveaway bill. Guess what? It reduces the deficit, all while putting us on a path to cutting carbon emissions in this country by 40 percent by 2030. Guess what else happened? Not a single Republican in this Chamber voted for that bill. Not one. Not one Member on the other side of the aisle voted to lower costs, voted for a clean energy future, voted to protect the environment, voted to protect our communities. We cannot drill and mine our way to a clean energy and climate secure future. Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford to pass H.R. 1. We cannot afford to send our communities back to the 19th century. We cannot afford to let private companies deforest and strip-mine our lands. We cannot afford to go back to a time when rivers were on fire, and companies dumped toxins into our groundwater with impunity. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this legislation because the path is clear. We must take climate action now and build a clean energy economy and leave a livable planet for our communities, for the future, and for our Nation."

              "Mr. Speaker, the amendment that I have proposed to the Lower Energy Costs Act will help Congress identify harmful regulations that have shut down American energy and increased costs on all Americans. This amendment instructs the EPA to identify and access existing regulations that have negatively impacted the United States' energy independence and energy security. This amendment will provide transparency about the actions taken by the Biden administration to increase regulatory burdens for energy producers, diminish energy output for the United States, and raise the cost of energy for all Americans. I grew up working in the west Texas oil fields, so I know firsthand that the best thing we can do for energy producers in our country is to get the Federal Government out of the way and reduce the number of burdensome regulations. Unfortunately, from day one, President Biden has waged war on American energy and done everything in his power to undo all the incredible work of the Trump administration to make our country energy independent. Since January 2021, the EPA has recklessly issued new rules and regulations with no regard for their adverse effects on Americans and our energy security. They have continued to diminish America's energy independence and take aim at America's interests and citizens without meaningful consultation with industry leaders or a logical plan to move forward. It is time we identify the EPA regulations that have played a direct role in shutting down our energy production and added additional expenses to the already burdensome day-to-day cost of living for Americans. As many of my Republican colleagues have mentioned, H.R. 1 is just the beginning of our work on critical energy solutions that will lift the red tape and expand the production of affordable and reliable energy rather than hamstring our domestic producers. The underlying bill is a strong piece of legislation that will reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign energy sources and get us back on track to putting America first. My amendment strengthens an already good bill and will allow Congress to pinpoint EPA regulations that negatively impact American families, small businesses, the agriculture industry, and our national security. We must show Americans that we will not stand by while the EPA puts the needs of the environmental special interest groups ahead of the needs of the American people. While some may wrongfully speak out against H.R. 1, this is an incredibly strong bill, and it is only the beginning of what the House majority is going to accomplish to unleash American energy. My amendment is a commonsense addition to the bill, and it instructs the EPA to conduct an after-action review to make sure we are doing what is in the best interests of our country. I urge every Member in this body to support my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "the amendment that I am offering here directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, as we refer to it, to withdraw two policy statements that massively expand the role of climate hysteria in certification of natural gas infrastructure, like pipelines and LNG export terminals. In February 2022, FERC released two radical policy statements that massively increased the role that the emissions play in its certification of natural gas pipelines and LNG export terminals, which are so critical to our ability to affect world consumption of gas so that we can drive down CO2 and expand our role in the world and expand American energy interests. This included requiring FERC to consider the upstream and downstream impact on emissions that building a new natural gas pipeline would have. Even Senator Manchin said: ``The Commission went too far by prioritizing a political agenda over their main mission--ensuring our Nation's energy reliability and security.'' I want everybody to hear this. This move by FERC came 1 week before Russia invaded Ukraine. This administration is perfectly fine empowering our enemies to appease the climate activists, the climate cult. We saw it with Nord Stream 2. We see it right here. We refuse to expand American energy right when we could be sticking it to Putin. Instead, we have everybody over here clamoring about what we need to do in Ukraine instead of having gotten in front of that by exporting American energy, by making sure that we control the world's supply of energy by putting out clean-burning American natural gas. Just 1 week after FERC made this move, Russia invaded Ukraine, massively disrupting European natural gas supplies. When the Western world was begging for U.S. LNG, this administration was giving them the middle finger to appease the climate cult. Meanwhile, our enemies--China, Iran, Russia, Venezuela--are massively pumping out emissions. China has 1,100 coal-fired plants. They are adding two a week. We are not adding squat to our natural gas or coal production capacity. Texas is about to be 50 percent wind and solar because we refuse to actually produce the coal and gas necessary to have power on a cloudy, windless day. China accounts for 30 percent of global emissions--and increasing. Russian natural gas exports to Europe release 41 percent more emissions than U.S. LNG. Bottom line: This administration's war on U.S. energy will not do a thing to help the environment but will hurt freedom and prosperity here and abroad. We should accept this amendment. This amendment should be agreed to across the spectrum because it is good for American oil and gas. It is good for the world. It will actually help drive down CO2 while making our country stronger and helping us push back on Russia in the process. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I frankly don't understand the purpose of this amendment. Last spring, FERC issued an updated policy statement, an interim guidance, detailing how the Commission should treat new applications for natural gas pipelines and account for greenhouse gas emissions. The Commission, a month later, clarified that both documents were drafts and that it would seek further input and comments on the drafts. That is it. These documents are not final rules or orders from the Commission. They are not law. They are a draft, draft documents that the Commission has put out to solicit industry and stakeholder feedback, and that is the way we want the government to work for it to be responsive. Withdrawing these documents from draft status, which is what I think the gentleman's amendment would do, would have no impact on any policy and, instead, I think, would just create further confusion and possibly release FERC from the duty to consider industry's comments on the draft. It may be that the real reason that the Republicans offered this amendment is that they don't think that FERC should consider greenhouse gas emissions. They don't think that these emissions should matter when FERC makes a decision about whether or not to authorize a new natural gas pipeline. This doesn't change the law. The law currently requires FERC to consider the greenhouse gas impacts of a certificate it grants. Multiple Federal court rulings have held that the agency must think about these issues based on the statute, and the interim policy statement was meant to create certainty for industry on how the Commission would do that. Instead, Republicans want to send FERC and, frankly, all parts of the Federal Government back into confusion. If you want to say that FERC shouldn't consider greenhouse gases--I am not in favor of that--you should amend the statute to say that. By simply saying that these draft rules should be withdrawn, that is going to tell industry, how do you deal with this? How are they going to know what to do if there are no rules, no policy, no input from them whatsoever? I think it would be wrong to change the statute to say that they shouldn't take greenhouse gas impacts into consideration, but that is not what this amendment does. This amendment says to just get rid of these drafts, and then industry would have no input into any of this. I don't think industry would support that. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "I support the underlying legislation to increase domestic energy production to replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that has been recklessly and dangerously drawn down by the Biden administration in a cynically political move to try to lower energy prices before an election. But we know that in a move to placate radical environmentalists, President Biden blocked the Keystone XL pipeline at the beginning of this administration. His administration suspended oil and natural gas leasing and permits when he took office. But for the last year, the President and his supporters have been pleading for more domestic energy production. The President can't have it both ways. In just over 2 years, the President has depleted the crude oil and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve by 40 percent. Not only did this scheme fail to bring down prices in a meaningful way for Americans, but it also threatens our energy and national security should a true national emergency occur. This is not just negligence from the administration. The administration is waging an active war against the oil and gas sector. Now, we all know about the war against leases, and we know about the war against energy infrastructure like Keystone. But ground zero, Mr. Speaker, for this war against domestic energy production is the weaponization of financial regulation to discriminate against American energy production and redirect capital away from American energy production. This is all happening at the precise time we need more, not less, energy production. The Energy Information Administration recently projected that global energy consumption will increase by 50 percent in the year 2050 with almost one-half of energy consumption coming from natural gas and other fossil fuel energy. So why do we need this amendment? Because this is a capital-intensive enterprise. In order for oil and gas production to happen, Mr. Speaker, you have to have the financing for that, and this Administration has weaponized the financial regulators to limit access to financing and to limit access to capital. For example, initiatives by the Federal Reserve working with a Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System, otherwise known as NGFS; the Securities and Exchange Commission's proposed Rules to Enhance and Standardize Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors; the Financial Stability Oversight Council's report and recommendation on climate-related financial risk; the FDIC's principles for climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions; and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's principles for climate-related financial risk management for large banks. My amendment would simply pause any and all of these climate-related financial regulations so that financial institutions can provide the capital and the financing for the oil and gas producers so that we can, in fact, replenish the petroleum reserve. There is no question that the war on energy is costing families and small businesses increased costs. Just in the first year of this administration, investment and oil and natural gas production dropped by 25 percent. It is time we unleash American energy to lower costs over the long run. That means we need access to capital--access to financing--for American energy. My amendment would give American energy companies access to our deep, liquid capital markets so that we can continue to power this country's economy and replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That is why I am offering this amendment: to protect American energy producers and to protect their access to capital markets so that we can facilitate the replenishment of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I would argue we need to unleash our financial institutions and our asset managers and investors to give our energy producers the financing that they need to rebuild our economy, to lower costs at the pump, and to lower energy costs across the board. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and, of course, support the underlying piece of legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Point of Order",
              "I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1, particularly division C, which was introduced in the House as H.R. 1152, and was marked up by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure with strong opposition from my Democratic colleagues. The polluters over the people act let polluters off the hook for harmful actions and damaging impacts to our rivers, lakes, and our streams that our local communities rely on for clean, safe drinking water. Division C is an attack on section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which is a key mechanism for States and Tribes to evaluate projects that cross within their borders and have an impact on their waters and environment for decades. Section 401 has been a successful example of cooperative federalism, while preserving State authority to manage their natural resources. Section 401 has been a well-supported, effective tool since the beginning of the Clean Water Act, but the Trump administration found a way to make it a scapegoat for the failure of senseless and harmfully polluting mega-projects. The provisions in the polluters over people act will tie the hands of States and Tribes seeking to preserve stream flow for their water supplies, to prevent runoff and water pollution, and to minimize impacts to flood-preventing wetlands. It goes against the Clean Water Act's rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution. First, in California, this bill would have huge impacts. For one, limiting analysis to only discharges would mean the State would be unable to consider the impact of the whole project, such as increasing impervious surfaces, or considering downstream effects. Our State is trying to preserve every drop of water we can get. Yet, this bill would stop my State from protecting its water supply from the adverse impacts of projects pursued by out-of-State interests. Second, this bill places arbitrary, and likely impossible timelines on the States to act on permit requests. Despite how complicated or huge the project might be, this bill will severely limit the time allowed for a State to review its impact. My friends across the aisle may not realize this, but this bill may lead to greater numbers of project rejections as the State is pressured to respond without the time to fully analyze the project. This bill is another attempt to gut--really gut--the Clean Water Act and allow pollution and industry to act without repercussion. We must defend human health, our economy, and the natural environment, and oppose the damaging bill that will harm local communities. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the State of California, State of Washington, and the State of New York in strong opposition to H.R. 1152, which is the bill that became division C, H.R. 1. February 28, 2023. Hon. Chairman Graves, Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Graves: As the water quality certifying agencies for California, New York, and Washington, we write to underscore the importance of existing law in protecting state waters from water pollution associated with federally licensed projects. On February 24, 2023, Representatives Rouzer and Graves introduced H.R. 1152--Water Quality Certification and Energy Project Improvement Act of 2023, to amend section 401 of the Clean Water Act that would, among other things, revise section 401 to: (1) reduce the scope of states' and tribes' 401 water quality certification authority to apply only to the discharge to a water of the United States, rather than the whole of the activity; (2) narrow states' and tribes' section 401 water quality certification authority to exclude much of what is required to comply with water quality standards and implementation plans under section 303 of the Clean Water Act; (3) remove the states' and tribes' authority to ensure compliance with ``other appropriate requirement[s] of State law''; (4) replace references to an ``application'' for certification with a ``request'' for certification; and (5) impose a time requirement on states and tribes to identify information needed before taking an action on a certification request, (6) make other changes to the law that introduce substantial uncertainty about the scope of section 401 for project proponents and state and tribes. Each of these changes would undermine states' abilities to protect water quality within their states and erode five decades of successful, cooperative federalism. We ask that Congress preserve the existing state authority in the Clean Water Act to substantively review a project's effects on water quality before a federal permit or license is issued. Background Under section 401 of the Clean Water Act, a federal agency may not issue a permit or license to conduct any activity that may result in any discharge into waters of the United States unless a section 401 water quality certification is issued, or certification is waived. The State Water Resources Control Board (``State Water Board'') and the nine California Regional Water Quality Control Boards (collectively, ``Water Boards''), [NY Signatory], [WA Signatory] are certifying agencies pursuant to section 401 of the Clean Water Act. In all three states, the most common federal licenses subject to section 401 are Clean Water Act section 404 dredge or fill permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and licenses for hydropower facilities issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. During the five decades since Congress enacted section 401 in the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970, state water quality agencies diligently processed thousands of section 401 requests each year with little controversy. The vast majority of section 401 certifications were issued promptly and most section 401 certifications were granted, with only a handful of denials issued each year. Beginning around 2016, prompted by a handful of high-profile section 401 denials, some project applicants and industry lobbyists began claiming that states were ``abusing'' their section 401 authority. Such claims of abuse are not, and never have been, true. In the handful of cases when project applicants have alleged improper certification decisions or delay by state agencies, they have been fully capable of protecting their rights under section 401 through the traditional framework of administrative and judicial review. Section 401 is a cornerstone of the cooperative federalism principles enshrined by the Clean Water Act Cooperative federalism is a foundational component of the Clean Water Act. As set forth in Clean Water Act section 101 (b), ``[i]t is the policy of the Congress to recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution'' and ``to plan the development and use . . . of land and water resources.'' Section 510 further specifies that except as expressly provided, nothing in the Clean Water Act shall preclude or deny the right of any State to adopt or enforce any standard or limitation respecting discharges of pollutants or any requirement respecting control or abatement of pollution. The section 401 certification program is an embodiment of these cooperative federalism principles. A state certification is the mechanism of ensuring that a federal license or permit is not used as an excuse to violate state or federal water quality standards. As currently written, the language in section 401 acknowledges that states are in the best position to understand their own laws and that additional conditions may be necessary to ensure compliance with state law and applicable Clean Water Act requirements. As the federal permitting or licensing agency is often not an agency primarily tasked with managing environmental issues, the federal agency may in fact be reliant on the certification authority's expertise regarding water quality. To prevent a section 401 certification from becoming a rubber stamp, any revision to the section 401 language must preserve an expansive view of the cooperative federalism principles originally envisioned by the Clean Water Act and repeatedly affirmed by the Supreme Court. PUD No. 1 of Jefferson Cnty. v. Washington Dep't of Ecology, 511 U.S. 700 (1994); S.D. Warren Co. v. Maine Bd. of Env't Prot., 547 U.S. 370 (2006). The Clean Water Act should continue to protect the whole range of water quality effects resulting from the proposed activity We strongly support the existing statutory language, which gives states and tribes the authority to regulate the potentially water-polluting activity as a whole, rather than being limited to a strict interpretation of effects from only the discharge, because regulation of the activity as a whole protects waters from the widest range of impacts. States should be able to protect water quality regardless of whether the pollution or other water quality impacts would be specifically attributable to a discharge or from some other aspect of the activity being permitted. States should be able to use the certification process to address impacts to groundwater, impacts to isolated surface waters, or impacts from non-point sources, all of which are likely not directly attributable to the discharge to a water of the United States, because these are water quality impacts that would not occur without issuance of the federal permit or license. The problems with limiting certifications to the discharge rather than the whole of the activity would be particularly impactful on the states' ability to protect water quality during the decades long term of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``FERC'') licenses in the hydropower licensing context. States and tribes must be able to fully address the water quality impacts of such activities as a whole during the 30- to 50-year term of the FERC license to reduce water quality impacts that, depending on the circumstances, may not be attributable to a point-source discharge, but result from the activity's construction, operations, and facilities. Common water quality impacts associated with hydropower activities include changes in turbidity, sediment, siltation, temperature, habitat loss, alterations to stream geomorphology, dissolved oxygen, algal productivity and algal-produced toxins, erosion, barriers to fish passage, alterations to stream geomorphology, and reductions in stream flow. Each of these impacts can have profound, generational impacts on the state's water resources. To prevent or minimize these potential impacts, states have imposed, or considered the need for certification conditions to protect water quality on project activities that fall outside the typical understanding of point-source discharges, such as requirements for minimum instream flows and ramping rates; temperature management; aquatic invasive species management; plans for gravel replenishment, large woody material placement and other habitat measures; reservoir operation plans; erosion and sediment management plans; and monitoring and management of dissolved oxygen, mercury, pesticides, and other constituents of concerns. Previously issued certifications have typically included management, monitoring, and reporting measures to ensure compliance with water quality measures and to identify potential modifications if circumstances change. Revising the statutory language to contradict longstanding interpretations would introduce confusion and invite arguments about the nexus between the discharge and the impact, when a state or tribe's focus should more appropriately be on all water quality impacts resulting from the project. Introducing the concept of whether the activity will ``directly result'' in a discharge in subsection (a)(1) and (a)(4) would inject additional uncertainty and potentially further limit the certifying authority's ability to protect water quality. Although the states would rely on their state authority to continue to preserve robust protection of water quality whenever possible, state authority would not be an available remedy where state law is preempted by federal law. Because the Federal Power Act preempts the field of hydropower regulation absent an express exception to preemption, and FERC project licenses are valid for a fixed period of up to 50 years, water quality certifications for FERC license applications provide the states with a singular opportunity to ensure compliance with the state's water quality standards and other requirements. If the states' ability to regulate FERC licensed projects to the same extent that it has been able to for decades is significantly weakened, other, non- FERC projects would be subject to more stringent requirements to compensate for the failure of FERC-licensed projects to contribute what would otherwise be their allocated responsibility. The Clean Water Act should continue to authorize certifications to implement water quality standards and implementation plans adopted or approved under section 303 of the Clean Water Act Under section 401 of the Clean Water Act a water quality certification implements the applicable provisions of sections 301, 302, 303, 306 and 307 of the Clean Water Act and any other appropriate requirement of state law. The most important of the enumerated provisions of the Clean Water Act is section 303, which provides for water quality standards and implementation plans. Section 303 requires development and approval of water quality standards, which consist of designated uses, criteria, and anti-degradation policies; establishment of total maximum daily loads, which allocate responsibility for meeting standards that cannot be met solely through compliance with the technology-based requirements of the Clean Water Act; and implementation of a continuing planning process. In 1994, the Supreme Court upheld state authority to set conditions of certification to protect uses designated as part of the water quality standards under section 303. PUD No. 1, 511 U.S. at 700. The Court rejected an argument that certification is limited to implementing the criteria component of those standards. Consistent with the Supreme Court's ruling, states have made effective use water quality certification authority to protect water quality needed for commercial, tribal, and recreational fisheries and other important uses of state waters. The proposed revision to limit ``applicable provisions'' of section 303 to ``requirement of state law implementing water quality criteria under section 303 necessary to support the designated use or uses of the receiving navigable waters'' could strip the states' authority to use their certification authority to protect the uses of waters of the United States designated as part of water quality standards under section 303. By inexplicably omitting any reference to federal requirements that implement section 303, it would also create substantial uncertainty about states' and tribes' ability to enforce water quality criteria, total maximum daily loads, and antidegradation requirements adopted by U.S. EPA. Congress should not remove the states' authority to require compliance with state water quality requirements We strongly oppose the bill's proposed revisions that would limit the certifying authority to ensuring compliance with only specific sections of the Clean Water Act by deleting the existing reference to ``any other appropriate requirement of State law'' set forth in section 401 subsection (d). Such a revision would disregard a state's right to impose more stringent water quality requirements and be contrary to the protective goals of the Clean Water Act. As is accounted for and endorsed by the Clean Water Act, many states have state-based programs and attendant requirements that arguably or explicitly expand beyond the state's Clean Water Act authorities. The Clean Water Act expressly contemplated a state's authority to establish and enforce more stringent state requirements beyond the Clean Water Act. For example, certifications may include monitoring and reporting requirements that arguably go beyond ensuring compliance with specific sections of the Clean Water Act, and instead help determine whether water quality is being degraded or to shape the development of future actions to protect water quality. We urge Congress to refrain from making an unwarranted intrusion into a state's authority to impose stricter conditions to protect the quality of waters within its borders. Section 401 should preserve the certifying authority's ability to define the contents of a request for certification and create submission procedures The bill proposes revising references to ``application'' to be ``request.'' Although the intention behind that revision is not clear, we support language that recognizes that the certifying authority may define the contents of a request for certification and create submission procedures. The state's ability to define what is required for a request for certification is significant because a receipt of such a request is the trigger for the beginning of the reasonable period of time for a certifying authority to act on the request. The bill proposes an addition requiring certifying authorities to ``publish requirements for certification,'' but it is not clear whether this language is an indirect reference to a certifying authority's ability to define required information for applications and submittal procedures. To the extent that ``requirements'' were intended to require the enactment of new state regulations, 30 days is insufficient time to comply with public notice and comment requirements for State Water Board adoption. Section 401 should not impose an arbitrary time limit on the certifying authority's ability to request information The bill proposes revisions to subsection (a)(1) that specify that by 90 days after request for a certification, the certifying authority must inform the applicant if any additional information is necessary for the certification authority to take an action on the request. As explained above, to the extent that the language requires the certifying authority to identify what, if any, information is necessary to submit a complete application for water quality certification, many state laws, including California's, do this. But the revised language may be construed as preventing the states from requesting that the applicant clarify, amplify, correct, or supplement information required in the application, which is permissible under state law. For these reasons, we write to ask that Congress preserve the existing state authority in Clean Water Act Section 401 to substantively review a project's effects on water quality before a federal permit or license is issued, and protect five decades of successful, cooperative federalism. Sincerely, Eileen Sobeck, Executive Director, California State Water Resources Control Board. Basil Seggos, Commissioner, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Laura Watson, Director, Washington State Department of Ecology.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, which will unlock United States energy potential, benefiting Missourians and Americans nationwide. Broadly speaking, this bill is important for so many reasons, from increasing domestic energy production to encouraging the production of critical minerals to modernizing the NEPA process for energy and other infrastructure projects. This bill does exactly what the title says. Division C of the bill was produced by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and it focuses on streamlining and clarifying the scope of section 401 of the Clean Water Act to prevent its continued abuse in blocking energy infrastructure projects. Many projects that require water quality certifications under section 401 are critical to our Nation's energy production, such as natural gas pipelines, LNG, and coal export terminals. Division C of the bill makes clear that States cannot block important energy projects on grounds outside of the Clean Water Act quality standards, consistent with the intent of the original law. Last month, H.R. 1152, which is encompassed within division C, was marked up and passed out of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. As included in H.R. 1, division C is incredibly important to lowering energy costs and boosting energy production while still ensuring water quality. Mr. Speaker, I thank two of my subcommittee chairmen, David Rouzer and Garret Graves, for their leadership in sponsoring this piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I would urge support of the bill. By passing H.R. 1, the House would support moving critical energy projects forward and support lowering costs for Americans through greater energy independence. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "H.R. 21 unnecessarily opens large swaths of public lands and waters to oil and gas drilling, including the coast of Florida. This would really jeopardize Florida's fragile offshore waters, our beautiful beaches. Clean water, clean air, clean beaches are central to our way of life, and are the cornerstone of our economy. For many years, the State of Florida has enjoyed a moratorium on drilling because leaders at the national level recognized that Florida beaches and our offshore waters were a national resource. That moratorium expired last year, unfortunately. So now with H.R. 21, Florida is at risk again. My amendment would reinstitute that moratorium. In fact, it would permanently ban drilling off of the coast of Florida. This has enjoyed bipartisan support here in the Congress and back home. How do Floridians feel about drilling off of our beaches? Well, we passed a constitutional amendment in 2018 that passed by almost 70 percent of the vote in the State of Florida. Democrats, Republicans, Independents, everyone values our way of life. Why? Because we are also keenly aware of how dirty it is, how risky it is. The impacts of oil drilling off our coast really came home to roost in 2010 after the BP Deepwater Horizon oil blowout severely affected the Gulf Coast marine ecosystems. Do you all remember that disaster, watching it day after day, month after month, after oil spewed into the Gulf of Mexico? At that time we were pretty fortunate on the West Coast of Florida, we didn't have oil that washed up on the beaches, but we were just coming out of the Great Recession. It was a hammer down on small business owners at that time. People were not coming to the Sunshine State. It caused enormous environmental impacts. I remember so well, holding in my arms and looking into the eyes of these small, mom and pop owners of motels and hotels and beach businesses, they were just devastated. We cannot put our economic and environment at risk again. It was a wake-up call. The eastern Gulf of Mexico also is an important military testing range. The Department of Defense has said they oppose oil drilling off the coast of Florida along the west coast because they do so many military training exercises. There are so many reasons that we need to act to protect our way of life, our environment, and our economy. It is what we sing about when we sing about protecting the Gulf Stream waters. This land is your land, this land is my land. They are not to be pillaged by the greed of the Big Oil companies. We are poised to make important progress on the health of our oceans and our economy. We are about to unleash the clean energy economy to create jobs, to lower costs for families, to build safer, healthier, and more resilient communities. We do not need to put our economy and our way of life at risk. So for all those reasons, I hope that all of the colleagues can join together to support the Castor amendment and permanently ban oil drilling off of the beautiful coastline of the State of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I rise in support of the amendment introduced by my friend and colleague, the gentlelady from Virginia. Virginia is blessed with beautiful coastlines. The Atlantic Coast and Chesapeake Bay provide critical habitat to marine life and offer numerous recreational opportunities to locals and tourists. Virginia's coasts are also home to a growing source of clean, affordable, and domestic energy thanks to ideal windspeeds, shallow waters, shipping lanes free of overhead obstruction, and a talented workforce. Located 27 miles off the coast, the first two turbines in federal waters are not visible from shore. The benefits they generate, however, are increasingly being felt on shore as emissions are lowered and good, family-sustaining jobs are created. These exciting developments are in sharp contrast to what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have planned for our coastal communities--an expansion of offshore drilling. We ought to learn from the tragic mistakes of our past: Exxon Valdez in the Prince William Sound, Santa Barbara off the coast of Southern California, and Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico. Throughout my career, I have opposed attempts to open Virginia's coastline to offshore drilling along with local communities, small businesses, scientists, beachgoers, environmentalists, seafood lovers, and people of faith. The Virginia Beach Restaurant Association, the Virginia Beach Hotel Association, and the Virginia Restaurant, Lodging and Travel Association all oppose offshore drilling along with Oceana, the Sierra Club, Chesapeake Climate Action Network, Surfrider Foundation, Virginia Interfaith Power & Light and so many others. National security experts also warn that offshore drilling is incompatible with military training in the region, not to mention the incredible harm a spill would do to military facilities. As sea levels in Norfolk and around the world continue to rise, any expansion of highly polluting fossil fuel infrastructure is simply a bad idea. Virginians are simply not willing to sacrifice the health of our climate, marine life, local economies, or coastal ecosystems to expand offshore drilling. The growth of offshore wind in the region further underscores the false choice being presented by my Republican colleagues. Virginians are already enhancing our energy security by harnessing the power of the wind. Thanks to the investments in the Inflation Reduction Act-- including provisions I introduced with Representatives Pascrell, Norcross, Luria, and the late Congressman McEachin--the future of offshore wind and domestic offshore wind manufacturing is bright. Virginians have repeatedly stood together to protect our coasts and, as this amendment demonstrates, we will continue to do so. I urge my colleagues to protect Virginia's coasts by supporting this amendment.",
              "as a proud Virginian, I rise today in defense of our region's coastal communities, our Nation's military and defense equities, the Chesapeake Bay, and the economy of the Commonwealth of Virginia. I am concerned that the legislation under consideration today would open the door to drilling of oil and gas off the shores of Virginia, something that has never been done before and something staunchly opposed by Virginians. Offshore oil and gas drilling poses a grave threat to our economy, our natural resources, and America's military infrastructure along Virginia's coast. Virginia's economy relies heavily on deepwater port commerce, and offshore drilling operations would severely impact these industries. According to one report, offshore drilling could jeopardize approximately 86,000 Virginia jobs, as well as roughly $4.8 billion in Virginia's GDP from coastal tourism, commercial fishing, and aquaculture alone. According to NOAA, in 2016, Virginia's commercial seafood industry collected more than 440 million pounds of seafood with a value of close to $300 million. This driver of Virginia's economy could be threatened under the overarching legislation considered here today. I also point out that Virginia's Wallops Island could come under threat. Wallops Island is home to space infrastructure that enables NASA missions, but offshore drilling could undermine decades of Federal, State, and local economic development efforts related to our space program. Virginia's spaceport has bolstered the local economy to the tune of $820 million annually, and it has provided thousands of jobs in our Commonwealth. Back in 2015, NASA raised the alarm bells about offshore drilling, releasing a statement that read, ``The presence of either temporary or fixed structures at or below the sea surface . . . would have significant detrimental effects on our ability to conduct aerospace test activities.'' Offshore drilling in Virginia has been shown to be a critical national security risk. According to a study published by the United States Department of Defense, any oil and gas leases off the coast of Virginia would disrupt military operations, training, and testing activities considered to be vital to our United States' national security and readiness. Finally, I am deeply concerned about the environmental impacts that offshore drilling could have in Virginia. As the largest estuary in the United States, the Chesapeake Bay has been recognized by Congress as a ``national treasure'' and has been under federally funded cleanup efforts since 1965. The Chesapeake Bay is home to more than 3,600 species of plant, fish, and animals--several dozen recognized as threatened or endangered. Over the last several decades, we have made tremendous progress in the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay. Virginians do not want to risk a disaster like the Deepwater Horizon spill. What is more, I am concerned about more regular releases of crude oil that occur in offshore operations. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation reports that spills from platforms, pipelines, and other offshore infrastructure release, on average, 157,000 barrels of oil annually. These releases would destroy many of the environmental gains that have helped revitalize Virginia's economy, Virginia's coastal communities, and the health of the Chesapeake Bay. I urge my colleagues, from those in Virginia to those across the country, to vote to protect Virginia's fishermen, farmers, coastal towns, beaches, natural beauty, and importantly, our national security by voting ``yes'' on this amendment. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

              "I thank my friend from Pennsylvania. I couldn't help but notice my colleagues on the other side of the aisle going, yet again, to one of their pages in their playbook that they love to bring out every single time we have a debate--oh, who can you trust? You can't trust corporate America. Guess what? I don't trust corporate America. I don't trust Big Oil. I don't. I don't trust them any more than I trust any of the big government bureaucrats that decide what is best for me. I do trust the market. I do trust people being able to go out and use their capital to go out and produce the best energy for the American people. This administration and my Democratic colleagues don't want to do that, as exemplified by the fact that the President of the United States dumped 300 million barrels out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve last year heading into an election. Mr. Speaker, 300 million barrels. They cut the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in half in order to bail out their election because their policies were so bad. Even Goldman Sachs is saying that the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which massively expands unreliable energy, would cost $1.2 trillion. That is the truth. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule for this bill. I think it is critically important that we take a massive step forward to try to ensure that we open up exploration on lands, repeal the methane tax, and overall permitting. It is only a simple step because the step that has to be taken is to free up the market from the ungodly amount of subsidies coming from Washington, subsidizing unreliable energy at the expense of capital being able to flow into the development of oil and natural gas and nuclear power to ensure that we have the power to live our lives. When you have a cloudy, windless day, you have to have power. This building is powered by natural gas. Hospitals across the country stay open because of natural gas. The fact of the matter is, you cannot power the world right now with wind and solar power. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle live in unicorn land with fairy dust, completely ignoring the reality of what happens to real Americans when the cost of their goods and services go up; when they have inflation skyrocketing and raising up; when it is destroying their way of life because people want to feel good about themselves hopping in their Tesla and rolling around pretending there is a magic energy tree. There isn't. People's lives are at stake. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle want the American people to lack the energy that they need to live their lives productively and affordably. You want to know why inflation is going up? Because this body has spent money it doesn't have. The Fed has printed money and jacked up the extent to which we have massive easy money out in the supply money. We have spent money we don't have. We have regulated the oil and gas industry to death, such that we don't have the ability to actually back up their magic fairy dust energy supplies with wind and solar.",
              "Mr. Speaker, my colleagues seem to want to debate energy policy in China and in Sri Lanka. That may be a fascinating topic, but that is not what we are here debating. We are here debating energy policy in the United States of America. I don't want us to go down the path of more fossil fuels and reliance on more energy sources that are going to contribute to climate change. I want us to lead the world toward a greener and cleaner energy future. I guess the question really here is: Who do you trust? My colleagues on the other side of the aisle, their argument is basically: Trust the big oil companies. Give them unfettered access. Give them more money and they will lower your prices. Really? They have the capacity to produce more now, but they are not, and they are gouging people at the pump. Does anybody believe that the CEOs of these big oil companies making record profits give a damn about average people in this country, about your constituents or my constituents? Give me a break. All they care about is profits. That is the question that people have to answer: Who do you trust? Do you trust the big oil companies? I certainly don't after the way they have behaved--not just recently, but over time. They gouge people all the time. The other stuff is fascinating, but we can talk about Sri Lanka at some other time. I would rather talk about the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, I urge that we defeat the previous question. If we do, I will offer an amendment to the rule to provide for consideration of a resolution that affirms the House's unwavering commitment to protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare, and states that it is the position of the House of Representatives to reject any cuts to these programs. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment into the Record along with extraneous material immediately prior to the vote on the previous question."

              "I rise in strong opposition to the gentlewoman's amendment which would expose historic ranching lands in Colorado to oil and gas extraction, extraction the community simply does not want. Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill we are considering today makes clear that some in this Chamber want to see our public lands, lands owned by all Americans, open to extensive new oil and gas extraction. As we have already heard, the bill risks opening an area more than three times the size of California to new oil and gas development; and this, despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of Americans, including more than two-thirds of western voters, consistently say that they would prefer to see public lands protected rather than opened to new degradation. Protecting these lands supports the climate, outdoor recreation, and local economies. In the case of this particular amendment, the community in Thompson Divide has already been fighting for more than two decades to protect this area from new oil and gas drilling. Since the early 2000s, the local community, including ranchers, farmers, sportsmen, businesspeople, and community leaders, worked together to fight for intact forests, big game and endangered species habitat, and the region's ranching history. Now the people of Thompson Divide have also opposed extraction because they have seen its effects firsthand. They have seen how companies more concerned with profit than public health polluted their streams, leaking toxic chemicals into the groundwater. The gentlewoman from Colorado, in the previous amendment, said that she wanted clean air and clean water, but that is not the case. That is not what is going to happen here with this amendment. To stem these impacts, Democratic Members, including my good friend and public lands defender, Representative Joe Neguse, has long championed protections for the Thompson Divide. Because of these longstanding efforts from the community and those who represented them, just last year, President Biden took action to protect this landscape from new extraction for the next 20 years. His decision to protect the Thompson Divide was cheered by citizens across the State of Colorado as an essential protection for an irreplaceable landscape. This amendment before us would reverse these protections, exposing this community again to poisoned wells and degraded forests. It goes against the interests of the Thompson Divide community, against the interests of Coloradans, and against the interests of the American people. So I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment is simple and straightforward. My amendment provides congressional disapproval of the denial of the Jordan Cove project permits. The Jordan Cove project was an important liquefied natural gas proposal that would have been the only West Coast LNG export terminal and would have been essential to exporting LNG to our allies in the Pacific and freedom around the world. The Department of Energy determined that the Jordan Cove project was expected to create 6,000 jobs during peak construction and generate up to $100 million in State and local tax revenue annually. Importantly, this project would have allowed us to export clean liquefied natural gas to our allies, many of which have been dependent on energy from Russia, OPEC, Venezuela, and even Iran. America makes the cleanest energy around the world. In fact, our natural gas is 42 percent cleaner than Russian gas. American innovation, in particular, fracking, has allowed America to be the global leader in emissions since 2000. In 2016, the United States Geological Survey released a report that increased the estimate of technically recoverable natural gas in the Mancos shale deposit from 1.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to a staggering 66.3 trillion, a 40-fold increase. David Ludlam, who worked for the West Slope Colorado Oil and Gas Association, said, there is enough natural gas to power the State of California for 50 years right in Colorado's Third District's backyard, and the need for our community to join the global energy marketplace has never been more urgent. A West Coast LNG export terminal would have shaved critical days and significant costs off exports to Asia, eliminated threats associated with hurricanes, and reduced our reliance on the Panama Canal, which causes significant uncertainty and delays. We should be advancing energy infrastructure projects to help ensure American energy dominance and help promote economic growth through a true all-of-the-above energy policy, not having elected politicians and bureaucrats pick winners and losers in the energy sector. Importantly, Jordan Cove has significant bipartisan support. In fact, the project in Colorado was supported by former-U.S. Senator Cory Gardner, U.S. Senator Michael Bennet, former-Governor John Hickenlooper, the Colorado Senate, the liberal Denver Post, the liberal Grand Junction Daily Sentinel, and local governments in western Colorado, including Mesa, Garfield, Rio Blanco, Moffat, Routt, Delta, and many other counties and municipalities in my region. While similar project proposals have languished for decades, Jordan Cove was on track for success after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted two Federal permits for the Jordan Cove Energy Project and issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity to the Pacific Connector Gas Pipeline in March of 2019. Unfortunately, the anti-pipeline, anti-natural gas, liberal Governor's administration in Oregon denied the permits and the certificate necessary for these projects, essentially killing the project in December of 2021 when the company pulled out, citing their inability to obtain the necessary State permits in the immediate future. If Green New Deal extremists in the Governor's office actually cared about the environment, they would have supported this project as natural gas emissions result in significantly fewer air pollutants and carbon dioxide emissions, and this important project would have advanced local, regional, and global emissions reduction goals. Like the Keystone XL pipeline, Jordan Cove was a major opportunity killed by extreme environmentalists whose sole agenda isn't protecting the environment, isn't being good stewards of what we have been blessed with, but is keeping our American energy sources in the ground and killing off fossil fuels. America deserves an American energy strategy that works for all Americans, and this amendment makes clear that we should not allow States with a misguided agenda to kill projects of national and global energy importance. Mr. Speaker, I support adoption of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment seeks to help provide a voice for local communities who were ignored and cut out of the process in October of last year when the Biden administration unilaterally locked up nearly 300,000 acres in Colorado and in my district through the stroke of a pen. Shamefully, the Biden administration ignored the concerns and opposition of impacted communities so he could appease Green New Deal extremists through this executive overreach. After the proposed land grab was announced, Kathleen Sgamma, president of Western Energy Alliance, stated: ``The White House has initiated a withdrawal for the Thompson Divide while advancing a false narrative that energy development and land protection are mutually exclusive. ``Oil and natural gas activity has taken place in the Thompson Divide area since the 1940s while conserving the land. We can do both: We can develop energy while protecting the land.'' The area remains a vital resource and is located within the second largest potential natural gas reserve in the United States. ``There's no need to lock away public lands and minerals, especially at a time of high energy prices.'' With gas prices skyrocketing again, and today's national average exceeding $3.50 per gallon, it makes even less sense to unilaterally lock up hundreds of thousands of acres from responsible energy production, especially while local stakeholders are ignored and are flatout opposed. After the mineral withdrawal and associated national monument were announced in October, the Ute Indian Tribe of Utah said: ``The White House moved forward with a monument on our homelands without including us. They talk about Tribal consultation, but their actions do not match their words. We cannot support a monument on our homelands that does not include the Tribe. It is a disgrace to our ancestors to exclude the Tribe in the care and protection of these burial sites.'' Garfield County Commissioner Tom Jankovsky sent me an email just this morning stating, ``President Biden unilaterally acted with an end run around Congress. Rather than honoring the 10-year, hard-fought, bipartisan support forged by local interests with Garfield County, the President placed additional restrictions on future leasing in Thompson Divide. This gutted the original bipartisan local support.'' My amendment requires the Secretary, as part of the plan required by this bill, to identify areas for potential responsible energy leasing within the second largest potential natural gas reserve in the United States in an area where responsible oil and gas production has taken place since the 1940s. America produces the cleanest energy in the world. In fact, our natural gas is 42 percent cleaner than Russian gas. American innovation, in particular, fracking, has allowed America to be the global leader in reducing emissions since 2000. America should have never been dependent on Russia for significant quantities of oil and gas. We need to stop begging OPEC, Venezuela, and even Iran, to produce energy for us, and start producing more energy responsibly right here in America, where our guys do it better than anyone else, more responsibly, and cleaner. We have to develop this right here at home, get back to American energy independence, and pursue energy dominance. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

              "I appreciate the work that the chairman and the committee have done on this very important piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about why we need H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act. I can't think of anybody in this country, especially working folks, especially the people in the Second Congressional District, who I represent, that say to me: Tim, I need to pay more for my energy. They don't. They say: My energy costs are out of sight. We have to feed our kids. We have to buy books for school. We have to buy clothing for our kids. We can't afford these higher energy costs. The Biden administration, unfortunately, and the Democrats in Congress keep pushing these Green New Deal-style agendas. Honestly, Mr. Speaker, they just don't work. There hasn't been a new development in solar in over 20 years, and windmills are just what they are. The wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine in east Tennessee, and I am sure that is the way it is across this great Nation. It is costing Americans way too much. We are done with all this nonsense, Mr. Speaker. H.R. 1 is going to end restrictions on importing and exporting natural gas. What could be wrong with that? Why in the world are we doing business with our enemies, the people we continue to send money to? We have hundreds of years, by recent estimates, of gas in the ground that we could be getting out using safe and environmentally sound methods. The burning apparatus now is so much safer than when this was first started, it is ridiculous. We need to fix this permitting process. We keep saying--and I have heard the White House say many times through their spokesperson--that we are permitting all these wells. Well, they don't permit the pipeline to get there. It is like we have a gallon of fuel in the ground and we are trying to pull it out with something about as big around as a needle point. We have to process our energy projects so they can get off the ground in a reasonable amount of time. By the time we get to the end of it, the cost is so high that it is very cost-prohibitive. We have to make the Biden administration resume the lease on most of our Federal lands and waters that they have restricted. We have to roll back President Biden's $27 billion slush fund for these Democrat special interest groups and these projects that amount to nothing but woke policy changes. We have to stop the liberal States from abusing section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which they use to add a bunch of unnecessary red tape to every project they don't like. It seems like when we find a good resource, they put these barriers in place. It is just not right. Mr. Speaker, we need to focus on keeping Americans' homes heated and their lights on. Nothing should be more important, especially since we are forced to purchase it from our enemies overseas--the people that hate our guts. They love our dollars. We pay them and the next thing you know, they are burning our flag. They are saying things about us that aren't true. They are causing us all kinds of problems. The best energy solution, Mr. Speaker, above all, is the solution that we need oil, gas, and nuclear energy--like they are working on at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. It is not in the district that I represent, but it backs up to where I am. There are over 6,000 people who work there that live in my district. It is also home to Big Ed's Pizza, which is a wonderful place--I will just throw that in. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1 is going to spur energy innovation at home, and I am proud to support it. I appreciate the great work that has been done on this issue.",
              "I thank the gentleman, who is doing a great job as chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, for yielding. Mr. Speaker, what should be crystal clear by now is that our friends across the aisle do not have solutions to the energy crisis. For the last 4 years, Democrats have controlled both Chambers of Congress, but in that time, not one single piece of serious legislation was ever introduced which would have lowered the cost of energy. After seeing costs rise for years on end, voters decided that they had had enough and elected Republicans to solve this crisis. In 2019, a gallon of gas cost just over $2. Today, it costs almost $4. The price of groceries has gone up, as the price of energy to ship and keep them cool has gone up as well. Some items have seen as high as a 55 percent increase. What has been done to help ease energy costs? What solutions do my friends across the aisle have? As a result of President Biden's Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the United States pumped $75.8 billion of taxpayer money into unreliable green tech. Besides that, Americans have pumped trillions of both public and private dollars into these industries for decades, but solar and wind combined still only make up 10 percent of American electricity generation. Instead of making existing technology more affordable, this administration and its allies in Congress dumped billions of dollars into technologies that cannot provide reliable and dispatchable energy to even a fraction of the country. This so-called solution has done nothing to lower costs for the average American. We have higher costs. There is more potential for rolling brownouts. This is the best that my friends across the aisle can do. An intelligent person would think, why not continue to invest in affordable and proven technology while we are waiting for these alternatives to become viable? They might be in the future at some point. That is great. But right now it is only 10 percent of our national electrical production. The PJM Interconnection, for example, which is a grid that services over 65 million people, has announced that they will be short 26 percent of their total energy obligations because radical environmentalists are retiring energy sources while providing no reliable backups. EPA also recently finalized what they are calling the ``Good Neighbor'' rule by denying 26 different State plans to conform to EPA ozone regulations. This denial means that 26 States, including my State of Colorado, will have sources of energy generation completely shut down while having no viable backup whatsoever. This decision guarantees that costs and shortages will continue to increase for the American people with no end in sight. Maintaining affordable energy is crucial to our way of life. It is what keeps water treatment plants open. It is what keeps hospitals open. It is what keeps traffic lights, libraries, schools, trucks, ships, and airplanes operating. When the cost of powering these essential processes go up, costs go up. If the grid shuts down, everything relying upon it goes down. This will have catastrophic consequences. Those of us around the country have seen what happens in places like California with its unrealistic energy policies and want nothing to do with it. High prices and shortages come with overregulation. Let's face the facts: Current green tech cannot come anywhere close to powering our Nation right now or in the foreseeable future. The Energy Information Administration expects fossil fuel demand to continue rising, not decreasing, beyond the year 2050. Ironically, as an aside, fossil fuel industries have always made a higher profit when there is a Democratic President because of the increased per barrel price of oil, but that is just an aside. Republicans also aren't neglecting permitting realities by ignoring unused drilling permits. We simply recognize that those permits on their own are insufficient to generate investment and production, especially when this administration is doing everything it can to discourage the producers of conventional energy. What should be clear in this debate is that Republicans are the ones who know how energy works, and we are passing legislation. H.R. 1 is serious legislation that will lower costs. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.",
              "I can make posters, too. I think I got the right backdrop there. Let's talk a little bit about credibility. Let's talk a little bit about the challenges that this country is experiencing, like the little girl on the playground and what our families across America are experiencing right now. Let's talk about why. This body is about credibility. It is about your word. Let's talk a little bit about why America is experiencing the challenges that they are. We are seeing higher electricity prices that are making American families unable to be able to afford medicine and groceries, refuel their car, or pay electricity bills. Why is that happening? It is happening because my friends across the aisle have refused to produce American energy. It is a supply and demand issue. This happened when they gained power. The day the President of the United States was inaugurated, Mr. Speaker, gasoline prices in my home State were as low as a $1.74 a gallon. Let me ask you, where in the world are you going to find that today? You have cut off production of oil and gas. Don't take my word for it. You know, one term I have never heard anybody say is bring back that Jimmy Carter energy policy. Yet, when Jimmy Carter was President, he leased 100 times more acres of the lands and waters for energy production. Why do we have a crisis in energy right now? It was self-inflicted. Why has this administration and these Democrats sold off hundreds of millions of barrels of oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the emergency reserve that was designed for crises, not awful policy? It is because they refused to produce energy. You have created a supply problem, and you are using our emergency reserves to address it. You sit here and also raise royalty rates. You proposed increased pipeline fees. You proposed taxes or enacted taxes on American energy, all driving up the costs, then you sit here and wonder why we have high prices? These were all self-inflicted wounds. You did this to America-- your policies. Mr. Speaker, it is remarkable seeing what is going on right now, listening to my friends across the aisle talking about the environment. Yet, their own legislation requires the use of critical minerals that they at the same time have banned or prevented from being mined or processed or refined in the United States. In some cases, China has 80 percent of these critical minerals locked up. If you force markets in the direction and if you force the use of those strategic materials, and the only place that has it is China, who are you benefiting? China loves their energy policies. They benefit from it. All roads lead to China. Over 80 percent of the solar panels are made in China. Whenever this administration found that China was illegally subsidizing and illegally dumping solar panels in the United States, they banned them and put tariffs on them. China then starts sending them through other countries. And you know what this administration does? They say: Yeah, that is fine. They acknowledge that there were Chinese solar panels being sent through other countries, and they allowed it. The Biden administration allowed it, and my friends across the aisle have done nothing to stop it. The truth is, is that emissions have gone up under their policies, not down. Mr. Speaker, let me say that again. Under the previous administration, emissions went down. Greenhouse gas emissions went down an average of 2\\1/2\\ percent a year. In the first year of the Biden administration, my friends across the aisle working with them closely, emissions went up 6 percent last year and went up another 1.3 or 1.4 percent. I am going to say it again. My friends across the aisle and their policies have resulted in higher greenhouse gas emissions. They have increased our dependence upon foreign energy sources. We had the Secretary of the Interior standing right in our committee, and he wasn't even aware that we had become increasingly dependent upon Russian energy. They talk about corporate welfare. I agree, which is why the over $600 billion that my friends across the aisle have put toward effectively bribing companies into investing in renewable energy sources that in many cases are not economic, simply doesn't make sense. This bill follows logic. It follows good policy. It ensures that we are getting energy resources from the United States. It ensures the affordability by bringing American energy online. It results in lower global emissions. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation."

              "Federal bureaucrats at the Department of Energy are threatening access to gas stoves for millions of Americans through the rulemaking process. In fact, the DOE admits that up to 50 percent of all gas stoves currently on the market or in use in American households will not meet the proposed standards. This amendment would stop the DOE from imposing this regulation. According to the DOE's own analysis, in 2020, 38 percent of Americans used natural gas to cook in their homes. The Energy Information Administration says cooking with gas is three times cheaper than cooking with electricity. The American people see this for what it is; a direct attack on all natural gas use in the country and another example of the Biden administration's desire to control every decision we make. Moreover, this rule is essentially a tax on consumers who are already being squeezed by inflation. My Democratic colleagues would argue that these rules were crafted for the purpose of saving consumers money. The DOE estimates the regulation would reduce energy use by 3.4 percent, resulting in a savings of only $21.89 over a gas range's life span. That is $1.45 per year over an average life span of 15 years for a gas range. These miniscule savings indicate this regulation is really not about the consumers' pocketbooks; it is about Federal control at the behest of radical green energy groups who want the complete elimination of the use of natural gas. I will point out were this to happen, there would be far less food to cook because natural gas is essential to fertilizer for food crops. Its elimination would cut food production in half worldwide. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "Mr. Speaker, my colleagues keep saying we are not banning gas stoves, but what would they call it when the Department of Energy's own analysis says that of the gas stoves that they have tested, only 4 percent of the market share would qualify for their new proposed rule? That means about 96 percent won't. Then they revised it to say, well, almost 50 percent will qualify. Well, that means more than 50 percent won't. I call that a ban. We are mixing words here. The other things that my Democratic colleagues keep asking is: Why wouldn't we want to save money? It is only 12 cents a month. Who is going to give up the choice of what type of stove they want for 12 cents a month? Nobody. That is not a good exchange. I would also say that if the Biden administration is not doing anything, why do all of these people support my bill? The National Association of Homebuilders, the American Restaurant Association, the American Gas Association, the American Home Appliance Manufacturers, numerous other energy companies. Mr. Speaker, I would read a little bit from the National Restaurant Association, because it talks about why this bill is important. We didn't bring it. The Republicans didn't bring this on; it was the Biden administration. With all these crises going on in our country, he has to pick on gas stoves. I don't understand why. This is what the National Restaurant Association says: Natural gas is a critical energy source for many sectors of the economy but none more than the restaurant industry. In fact, natural gas is the preferred cooking energy source for 76 percent of restaurants. Cooking with an open flame from natural gas is critical for a variety of dishes to ensure a responsive, consistent, and precise heat source that affects the quality of food served. Natural gas also allows restaurants to use certain cooking techniques that cannot be replicated with an electric stove. Finally, banning or overly restricting natural gas use could burden restaurant owners with higher operating costs, particularly local and independent restaurants. The cost to convert existing infrastructure to handle the power capacity needed to operate a commercial kitchen alone would be prohibitive for many locally owned restaurants. I say the same is true for individual homeowners. They don't want to change. They like the features on their gas stove. They don't want to give them up. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support my bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, the Save Our Gas Stoves Act. I never would have thought that I would need to introduce legislation to protect Americans' kitchen appliances, but this only goes to show how out of touch this administration's policies have become. In February, the Department of Energy proposed an extreme regulation that would effectively eliminate nearly all gas stoves and gas cooktops on the market today. The Department's proposed rule sets requirements for gas stoves at the maximum technologically feasible, or max-tech level. Based on the Department of Energy's own analysis and DOE's own technology support report, 96 percent of the market share of gas stoves will not, I repeat, not meet DOE's new proposed rule. That is a 96 percent ban. Worse yet, no gas ranges passed DOE's new proposed rule tests. Gas ranges represent nearly 90 percent of all gas stoves sold. What did DOE do after the public heard about this and pushed back? They adjusted their analysis, seemingly out of thin air. Now, they claim that nearly 50 percent of gas stoves will pass their rule. Guess what? That means more than 50 percent won't. Don't tell me they are not trying to ban gas stoves. The DOE is justifying this proposed requirement under the false guise of saving Americans money. However, the estimated savings is just $21.89 over the next 14\\1/2\\ years. That is only $1.50 per year or 12 cents per month. Consumers don't want to give up the features of the stoves they like for 12 cents per month. Consumers don't want to wait an extra 7 minutes to watch a pot of water boil for 12 cents per month. Instead of DOE bragging about how they are going to save consumers 12 cents per month, maybe they should tell the public that natural gas is 3\\1/2\\ times cheaper than electricity and that, according to studies, households that use natural gas for heating, cooking, and drying clothes save an average of $1,068 per year. Consumers don't want the government taking away the features on gas stoves that they like and use. That is not the role of the U.S. Government. That is why I introduced the Save Our Gas Stoves Act to protect Americans' consumer choice. My legislation prohibits the Department of Energy from implementing this extreme rule and prohibits the Department of Energy from imposing standards that result in the unavailability of a product based on the type of fuel the product consumes. Mr. Speaker, I thank the American Association of Homebuilders; the American Restaurant Association; the American Gas Association; the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers; the Arizona Restaurant Association; the American Public Gas Association; the National Propane Gas Association; and several energy companies, including Southwest Gas, which delivers natural gas to consumers in Arizona, for their support of my bill and for their support for American consumer choice. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that this is a bipartisan bill that has received bipartisan support and that my Republican colleagues and 29 of my Democratic colleagues already voted in favor of an amendment to H.R. 1 that did virtually the same thing as this bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my bill. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of consumer choice. I urge my colleagues to vote to save our gas stoves. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "first of all, I think the gentlewoman's previous amendment was about the policies of the President being political. And I think this amendment is more political than anything. First of all, as we know, what the underlying bill does is it says that if the President wants to release crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, then he has to put together a plan that would require more leases on public lands. What the gentlewoman's amendment says now is that she makes this retroactive and goes back to the day of the President's inauguration-- again, a very political decision to use that date--and says that any releases from the reserve beginning on the day of the President's inauguration, we would also then have to go back and make sure that we sell or lease additional leases on public lands to cover those releases from the reserve back to the inauguration. So, the bureaucracy of all this in itself I think is absurd. But the point is that she is essentially saying that now we have to lease more public lands when, in fact, there are about 9,000 leases already on public lands, half of which are not being used. The oil companies do not want to pump more oil because that brings down the price. They don't want any releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because that brings down the price. So all that the Republican majority is doing here is trying to help the oil companies, trying to make sure that there are no tools on the part of the administration to increase the supply, to bring down the cost of gasoline at the pump. Whatever the oil companies, which are making huge profits, want to do, that is what they want to do, as well. So I would just again say that this amendment may be germane but it is certainly detrimental to what the President and the Democrats are trying to do to help people deal with affordability.",
              "I listened to the gentlewoman from Georgia, and to me, this amendment is unbelievable. I mean, she says that you can't draw down or sell petroleum products under this amendment for political and nonemergency purposes. Well, I mean, everything around here is political, so I don't know how you would define that. What the President has been doing is using this Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help bring down the price of gasoline at the pump, or in other cases, to increase supply because of the supply shortage due to Russia's action in the invasion of Ukraine. These are, in my opinion, totally legitimate emergency purposes to help the American people and help the supply chain. What the bill does is to say: Well, if you want to do that--if you want to use the reserve--then you have to drill for more oil on public lands. Well, isn't that political. A decision is made to say that you can't use the reserve unless you help the oil companies and let the oil companies take more of our public lands. That is about the most political thing that I can think of. In addition to that, was it not political when the Republican administrations in the past released and sold oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve? What did they do it for. Well, they did it for deficit reduction. They did it to pay for different items, like the 21st Century Cures bill that came out of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Were those emergencies? Were those not political? I would argue that using the reserve for those purposes was not an emergency at all and certainly was incredibly political. This is just another example of what the Republicans are doing. They are politicizing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because they want to make message points. They know that this bill isn't going anywhere. The President already said that he will veto it, and the Senate won't take it up. They are being so political. They are talking about situations that have nothing to do with an emergency. I really don't know what to say. The whole process here is very political, oriented toward messaging, oriented toward going on TV, I guess, to appeal to base voters. It is just incredible to me that this amendment is being offered. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I can only characterize this amendment as extreme. If adopted, this amendment would make an already reckless bill even more careless and would weaken our national energy security. Now, let me say that I totally disagree with what the gentlewoman just said. First of all, what President Biden has done, as we have said repeatedly today, is to release crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to bring down gas prices. And he actually accomplished that goal. It worked by bringing down prices about a $1.50 per gallon since the peak last June. In addition to that, we have set forth that this was to address the supply chain because we know that with the war in Ukraine, the supply chain was severely limited, and one of the purposes of releasing oil from the reserve was to have more in the supply chain. The gentlewoman also suggested that this administration is restricting the use of public lands for drilling. That is simply not the case. One-half of the public lands are available for drilling. As I have said before, the oil companies simply don't want to drill because they want to keep the prices artificially high. Now, what the gentlewoman has done--and I just want to explain this in a little detail. Right now, the bill before us does have an exemption that says that you don't have to drill or put forth a plan to drill on public lands if certain criteria are met. It says that during a severe energy supply interruption, if the President determines that an emergency situation exists and there is a significant reduction in supply, a severe increase in the price of petroleum products and/or such price increase is likely to cause a major adverse impact on the national economy. So even under this underlying bill, if those criteria are met, then the President can use the SPR and release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for these reasons. What the gentlewoman has done--or tries to do--in this amendment is eliminate those exemptions. So essentially what she is saying--this is why this is so extreme--is she is saying it doesn't matter if there is a problem with high prices. It doesn't matter if there is a problem with the supply chain. We are not going to let the President release oil from the reserve for any reason whatsoever unless a plan is put forward to allow for more drilling on public lands. That is extreme. Even the Republican leadership doesn't support that. She is saying no exemptions whatsoever. Imagine what this would do if we had no flexibility whatsoever no matter what the price was, no matter what the supply was, and no matter what the emergency is, not allowed. You have got to put together a plan which could take years to put forward a way of drilling more on public lands before we would be able to use this tool which is so important for national security. This is really, in my opinion, outrageous and extreme. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to oppose the amendment for this reason, and I yield back the balance of my time."

              "this amendment simply ensures that no undue influence can be wielded by the Chinese Communist Party using an existing provision, which I think reflects the overall sentiment behind this anti-CCP and forced labor provision of the entire bill. The underlying section allows the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to accept and expend funds from non-Federal entities in order to pay for staff and information technology system development to expedite permit processing. They are authorized to accept funds in fiscal years 2023 through 2025. This amendment prohibits those Secretaries from accepting contributions from non-Federal entities owned by the Communist Party of China or a person or entity acting on behalf of the Communist Party of China. Seems pretty common sense. There are already provisions in the bill which would prohibit the CCP's involvement in certain parts of our energy market. They should not be allowed to participate in this one any more than they do in the others. There is no reason that our government should be accepting money from this well. Let's remind ourselves that we are not talking about the people of China who wish to breathe free, like all people in the world do. We are talking about the Communist Party of China. We don't need anything from them. Mr. Speaker, I urge support and adoption of this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank the ranking member and appreciate bipartisan support on this very important amendment. I think this is a sign that we are making progress. This is a sign that America is coming together to stand up against the Chinese Communist Party. We need to stand up not only against them but we need to continue standing up against Russia, against OPEC. That is what H.R. 1 does. It is a bold step in the right direction, and this is a small part of it. I commend the gentleman from Tennessee for crafting this amendment and for getting it made in order. I support the amendment for a very good reason: We simply cannot let the Chinese Communist Party continue to dominate and take control of not only mineral supply chains but energy supply chains as they are trying to make a move in that area as well, where they are cozying up with the Saudis. They are working with Russia to buy the oil and gas that we have banned from there. Their objective is dominance. They have made great strides in the minerals area, and they are working very hard to do that in energy. The way we push back against China and the CCP is we produce our energy and minerals here, and we, for sure, don't let China come to America and own any kind of lease on Federal lands or private lands. We produce it ourselves. We send it to our allies. There was a delegation recently in Germany, and the message they brought back from Germany was gas equals peace. They want us to send them our gas, and we have ample supplies of it. We just need the pipelines. We need the ports. We need the LNG facilities. We need the vessels to send gas to Europe that is much cleaner than the gas they are getting from Russia. It will help bring peace in Europe if they can get more of our energy here. Mr. Speaker, I again commend the gentleman, and I support the amendment.",
              "I rise today in support of my amendment to require the Secretary of Energy to disclose certain stakeholder meetings with any entity that has: one, ties to the People's Republic of China or the Chinese Communist Party; two, has produced studies regarding or has advocated for policies to limit, restrict, or ban the use of any type of energy; and, three, has applied for or received Federal funds. We have recently seen concerning examples of anti-energy, China- connected entities receiving not just elevated access to the White House and Federal agencies but granting of funds, as well. Literally, we have been using U.S. taxpayer dollars to help fund them. I introduced this amendment because the Biden administration has not been transparent about who it has been meeting with, and frankly, I believe this administration has not been honest with the American people about its desire to ban gas stoves. In February of this year, it was widely reported that a government watchdog group obtained information through the Freedom of Information Act revealing a private meeting between the Secretary of Energy and a group that would be covered by this amendment. In particular, this group has been on the forefront of the effort to ban gas stoves. Unsurprisingly, when I sent a letter to Secretary Granholm in February, inquiring whether she was aware of this group's ties to China and the extent of their influence on the Department, I received a letter back that was completely ignoring my questions and concerns. I have to give you a little bit of perspective, Mr. Speaker. My family has been involved in construction for over three generations, and I fully understand the needs that people have at various levels in their homes and their businesses. I mean, we are talking about gas stoves today. Don't get me wrong. There is nothing inherently wrong with electric stoves. That oftentimes fits very nicely--same thing with electric base heat or water heaters, et cetera. There are certain regions of the country, like in Michigan and the upper Midwest, where we are very dependent on propane and natural gas. We don't have the electric grid to support an expansion of that. I know the other side will say that nobody is going to pull your stove out of your house--yet. Nobody is doing anything other than just stoves--yet. We know that places like California, New York, and even in Michigan, the city of Ann Arbor, have gone in and literally banned the addition of and use of gas stoves. They are looking to expand that. They have talked about that. The real rub here, Mr. Speaker, is that we have a major problem with questionable groups with established connections to China. They have those established connections, but we are not sure what their unanswered intentions might be. They are succeeding in influencing policy to limit affordable appliance options for Americans. When President Biden or Senate Majority Leader Schumer are telling the American people that no one is going after their stoves, they may be technically correct today, Mr. Speaker. In the broader picture, we know that that may be coming. I have to say that it is one thing for elected officials to be going after a particular appliance or source of energy, but we have a real problem when Washington bureaucrats, unelected bureaucrats, aren't being honest about their end goal, and they are the ones making the rules and regulations. A ban on gas stoves is going to cost the taxpayers. It is going to cost hardworking, honest Americans more when they are already in an inflationary heightened situation. That is why I wanted to bring this amendment. I appreciate the author's acceptance of this and understanding of where we are trying to go with this. At the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, my amendment is simply to bring an added dose of transparency, expose connections to the CCP, which I truly, honestly believe that both sides of the aisle have concerns about the tentacles of the CCP and the Chinese Government and the influence that it has gained here in the United States. That is why, on the Financial Services Committee that I serve on, we have done CFIUS reviews, which is making sure that it is property and technology and other things that we are protecting from our adversaries like China. Why would we hand over the keys to this particular kingdom? I don't understand. We need to let the American people know who is truly influencing our government and that exposure is there. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time."

              "I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 21, and I urge all my colleagues to oppose this big giveaway to Big Oil. The bill before us today is yet another effort to open our public lands and waters to major new oil and gas extraction. This is despite the fact that oil companies already control huge amounts of our public lands and waters, most of which they don't even use. Right now, oil and gas companies have about 9,000 approved but unused permits across 26 million acres of public land. Right now, offshore they have 2,000 active leases covering 12 million acres, three-quarters of which aren't being used. This bill asks us to give them even more land--an area three times the size of California, or more than 300 million additional acres. Big Oil has more public land than they can use. They could expand production today if they really wanted to. Instead, they lobby Congress to open up even more lands to extraction, to lower environmental standards, and to give them more taxpayer-funded subsidies. And in the process, they lock out public land and public access from other essential uses that would contribute to the American people and contribute to the mitigation and remediation and the climate action that is required around the issue of climate and the climate crisis. To add insult to injury, this bill would actually make it harder to help everyday Americans. It would prevent the President's ability to keep down gas prices. Last year, President Biden took decisive action, allowing releases from the reserve to lower prices at the pump. Under this bill, if the President needed to act again to keep prices low, he would first have to pay off Big Oil by opening up our public lands. This bill does not protect the American people, and it certainly doesn't protect our climate or environment. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''",
              "this amendment requires oil and gas companies operating on our public lands to make one simple pledge to the American people, that it won't gouge consumers at the pump. It requires the Secretary of Energy to secure that commitment before any new permit to increase production on our lands will be approved. It would help prevent some of the damage that this disastrous bill would do to our Nation's ability to address skyrocketing energy prices in the country. Frankly, the bill before us is nothing more than a shameless attempt by my Republican colleagues to help increase drilling. If this bill were titled correctly, it would be known as the big win for Big Oil act, and it would come at a huge price for the American people. As the chair of the Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee in the last Congress, I have been on the front lines to bring down gas prices in this country. I held a hearing last year with the top executives from six of the Nation's largest oil producers to have them explain why Americans were suddenly being asked to pay record-high prices at the pump and why Americans should be forced to provide their companies billions of dollars in subsidies each year when they were reporting record-high profits and hardworking families were struggling hard to fill up their cars. Despite what the supporters of this bill will tell you, not one executive at that hearing claimed that opening up Federal land for drilling would lower prices at the pump. In fact, one executive at that hearing even admitted that opening up more land to drilling in the country would do nothing to bring the cost of gasoline down. Why? Because there is nothing--and I repeat, nothing--preventing the oil industry from expanding its production tomorrow if they wanted to. They just choose not to because of profits. The oil industry currently leases 26.6 million acres of Federal lands. Less than half of that land under current lease, 12.7 acres, is currently being used for production, so there is no relationship between opening up more Federal lands for the production of oil and gas and the price that Americans pay at the pump. None. Instead of helping to bring down prices for consumers, what this bill does is it really makes it harder for future administrations to respond. It takes away the one tool that has been used effectively to help alleviate the pain consumers were suddenly feeling this past summer and the one tool we have to prevent it from happening again. It prevents the President from releasing our Nation's oil reserves on to the market during a crisis. It prevents the administration from taking the steps necessary to curb excessive price increases that can cause real harm to people, family, and businesses across this country. If Republicans were serious about helping consumers, let's do it, but let's do it explicitly. Let's include in this bill a provision that will expressly prohibit these companies from gouging consumers at the pump. My amendment requires the Secretary of Energy to secure from any oil company looking to increase production on Federal lands a commitment that it will not excessively increase its prices during periods of future disruption. It gives the oil companies what the Republicans say the industry wants, which is the ability to increase production on the public lands. So all we ask for--all we ask for--Mr. Speaker, is a simple commitment that they won't gouge consumers at the pump. Sounds like a win-win to me. I would urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment to the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Point of Order",
              "again, I don't know how to characterize this but to say it is extreme. The gentlewoman's amendment would provide an even bigger handout to Big Oil, trading away our precious Federal lands. Now, just so we understand, right now, there is a limitation in the underlying bill which, of course, we still oppose because the underlying bill says that the plan--in other words, I think we all know that this underlying bill says: You can't use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve unless you open up more Federal or public lands to oil and gas drillings. But it does have a cap that says the plan required shall not provide for a total increase in the percentage of Federal lands described, lease for oil and gas, in excess of 10 percent. Let me just give you an idea. In the underlying bill, it could result in over 300 million acres of Federal lands being opened up for new oil and gas drilling, an area equivalent to three times the size of California and eight times the amount of Federal lands and waters currently available for oil and gas development. But the gentlewoman from Colorado says that is not good enough. The government has to allow for another 5 percent beyond that, another 50 percent more than what I described in order for us to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Again, the fossil fuel industry already controls large portions of U.S. public lands and waters, and it isn't using most of it. Right now, the fossil fuel industry is sitting on approximately 9,000 approved but unused permits for drilling on public lands. In total, the fossil fuel industry controls over 26 million acres of U.S. onshore public lands, half of which is going unused. Offshore, the fossil fuel industry has over 2,000 active leases, covering 12 million acres of Federal water, 75 percent of which is not being used to produce oil or gas. So the gentlewoman says that she wants clean air and clean water. Well, the consequence of this would be just the opposite. We would be polluting the air and probably polluting the water as well, so it makes absolutely no sense. I mean, right now, there is nothing to stand in the way of production, which is up 1 million barrels a day under President Biden, not to mention oil and gas companies are sitting on billions of dollars. They are making huge profits. The oil and gas companies don't want to produce more oil here in the United States because that would lower the price. They are about profits. They are about raising the price of gasoline at the pump. By using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, President Biden has reduced the price at the pump. So what the gentlewoman is proposing is extreme because this even allows more public lands to be leased, or require it, that is not going to be pumped anyway because the oil companies don't want it, and at the same time, prohibit this administration from actually helping the American consumer by lowering prices. It is extreme. Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to oppose it, and I yield back the balance of my time."

              "if you don't want to vote for this, I get it. You can tell your constituents at home that you stand for people that are unelected. Most folks at home have never even heard of the Delaware River Basin Commission. They don't even know about interstate compacts. Here is what they know: They want to live their lives, and they want to vote for elected officials to make decisions that are important to them. If it is so dangerous, how come it is banned here but not there? In the rest of Pennsylvania, we do it. Mr. Speaker, this is just taking the people's rights away, their voices away from their elected officials, and it is literally the definition of tyranny. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "the Delaware River Basin Commission is made up of representatives from the States of New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and my home State of New Jersey. The commission oversees drinking water quality for the Delaware River Watershed, a vitally important role that impacts millions of people across four States. Congress created the commission over 60 years ago and gave it powers to regulate the Delaware River Watershed. Crucially, each State's democratically elected leaders signed up to join the commission, and each State receives a vote on the commission. Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, the commission banned fracking in its watershed, and this wasn't a controversial decision. In fact, it was unanimous. It was a 4-0 vote to help protect the public health of the 13 million citizens in the watershed and to preserve the waters themselves. Today, Republicans want to retroactively take away the rights of the citizens of these four States and their elected representatives. They want to take away the powers that Congress gave the commission just because they don't like the outcome. I would suggest this: If you really care about clean rivers and waters, I urge you to oppose this amendment. If you care about people's rights to safe drinking water, I urge you to oppose this amendment. I would like to think that all my colleagues care about these things, so I urge opposition to the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "The Governors are the four commissioners. The Governor of Pennsylvania is the chairman of the commission. They may delegate to someone to actually go to the meetings, but they are making these decisions. I don't understand how my colleagues on the other side of the aisle think that we should take away the rights of the Governors who are on these commissions to make the decision that was a 4-0 decision. If they decide that they want something different in the Delaware watershed than in their individual States, that is their prerogative, but they made this decision. They voted 4-0. Again, I don't see the point, and I think it is really egregious for us to take away the powers of the Governors, as they are elected by the people of the four States to make this decision about fracking within their watershed. Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time."

              "as much as I appreciate Mr. Levin and his real sincerity and work on the committee, on this bill, and his expertise in this area, I must oppose this amendment tonight and hope to work with him on some additional legislation in the future. This amendment would strike all of the provisions in division B that increase domestic energy production and reduce energy costs for American families. This amendment prevents division B from going into effect until all of the Federal agencies impacted certify that they have adequate funding and staffing to meet the timelines in the bill. In response, I ask a simple question: When has a Federal bureaucracy ever felt it has enough staff on its payroll or enough taxpayer dollars to spend in its budget? The answer is never, at least not as long as I have been in Congress and I have talked to Federal agencies. Even with the spending push by the Democrats in the so-called Inflation Reduction Act--they have stated several times during the debate on H.R. 1 that they have put a billion dollars out there to speed up permitting--these Federal agencies are still asking for more money and more staff, and permitting timelines are still ballooning. Why? Because the issue is not an issue of staffing or budget alone. The underlying statutes and the processes are broken, and they must be fixed. That is what H.R. 1 does. It addresses the underlying issues, and it will expedite permitting for all kinds of projects. This messaging amendment would prevent meaningful reforms in the name of growing the Federal bureaucracy. For these reasons, I oppose this amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in opposition. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).",
              "this amendment simply requires Federal agencies to certify that they have the staffing capacity to meet the new environmental timelines established under this bill. According to the Government Accountability Office, the main reason for project delays at the Federal level is a lack of agency resources and staff capacity. Thankfully, we helped address this challenge by securing $1 billion in the IRA to ensure Federal agencies have the resources and expertise to conduct efficient environmental reviews. A trained, equipped workforce is essential to processing environmental reviews in a timely fashion in cases where there are delays. Increasing the funding and staff for Federal agencies' permitting offices and agency workforce training is already making the permitting process significantly more effective and efficient in a responsible way. Unfortunately, instead of building on the progress we made in the Inflation Reduction Act and supporting agencies' capacity to conduct reviews by providing additional resources, H.R. 1 takes the more politically expedient but impractical approach of simply forcing agencies onto stricter timelines for reviews without providing additional resources for Federal agencies to conduct these reviews. By instituting these strict deadlines and limiting opportunities for community input throughout this bill, I am worried that instead of leading to more efficient project reviews and approvals, H.R. 1 may actually lead to sloppier and rushed reviews. When environmental reviews are not thorough, projects often face a litany of time- consuming lawsuits and litigation. As some may know, I used to work on clean energy projects before coming to Congress, and my own experience is that detailed environmental reviews and a thoughtful permitting process alongside early engagement with impacted communities can facilitate more efficient completion of projects and better overall outcomes. This amendment would help support efficient reviews by requiring that the Council on Environmental Quality in consultation with affected Federal agencies certify that all agencies have the funding and staffing capacity to meet the new timelines for environmental review required under the bill. It is common sense that we should not be instituting arbitrary timelines if agencies don't have the necessary resources to meet them. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to ensure that affected agencies have the resources needed to conduct high-quality reviews, which will lead to better overall project outcomes. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1. As one of the few Members who serves on both the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Natural Resources, I have seen almost every version of this package as it was crafted. Hearing after hearing and markup after markup, it has been clear. I love my Republican colleagues, but they are more focused on advancing partisan bills that will benefit the oil, gas, and mining industries while selling out landmark environmental laws in the name of permitting reform, instead of advancing meaningful, bipartisan solutions for the American people that will help us achieve our climate goals and solidify our energy security for future generations. For months now, my Republican colleagues have called for policies and permitting reforms in Congress that would strengthen our energy security. I have consistently been willing to work with my colleagues-- and still want to--in this pursuit, but what we have here is not reform. Gutting the National Environmental Policy Act, otherwise known as NEPA, is not permitting reform. Weakening enforcement under the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and other critical public health laws is not permitting reform. Granting mining companies the ability to take minerals from public lands without paying a dime to taxpayers in royalties or helping clean up these toxic sites afterward is not permitting reform. Forcing Federal agencies to hold oil and gas sales on public lands, even if they are not needed, is not permitting reform. Repealing the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27 billion program, that I admit I helped author, to deploy clean energy projects nationwide and cut greenhouse gas pollution, is not permitting reform and will not strengthen our energy security in any meaningful way. To my Republican colleagues who continue to refuse to believe the science or to acknowledge we are facing an existential threat from the climate crisis, just read the United Nation's most recent IPCC report from 2022. This legislation instead puts polluters, profits, and pollution over the American people. It is that simple. In order to truly attain meaningful energy independence here at home, we need a net zero energy economy built on solar, wind, hydropower, batteries, electric vehicles, and even nuclear. What we cannot do is expect more drilling for oil and gas to solve all of our current and future energy woes. I do understand bad weather. The last four weekends, I have had snow and ice, and I have lost my electricity every single weekend. Listen, we are at the beginning of a transformational shift toward a clean energy economy, a shift that has now accelerated due to the historic investments and legislation Democrats and the Biden-Harris administration were able to enact into law over the last 2 years. This transition will likely present the greatest permitting challenge in generations. However, we must permit and build in ways that do not harm communities or our environment. That is why Democrats enacted historic legislation last Congress, the Inflation Reduction Act, that directed over a billion-dollar investment to increase staffing and resources across Federal agencies for conducting efficient and effective environmental reviews and permitting. The bill today doesn't have real solutions to high energy costs, and it is going to drive up the deficit, not according to Democrats, but according to the independent Congressional Budget Office. I am pragmatic and I am seasoned enough to know we have a lot of work ahead. If we can do it collectively, Republicans and Democrats, it can serve as an important tool to combat climate change, strengthen our economy, and protect our national security. But again, let me be clear: We must not entertain proposals that roll back landmark environmental laws across the board, including NEPA, so we can line the pockets of Big Oil. As I mentioned at committee, when John Dingell and Senator ``Scoop'' Jackson originally authored and advanced the National Environmental Policy Act, it was done thoughtfully, through a meaningful legislative process, to build broad and bipartisan support. This is the process that we need. We can't gut NEPA. It was brought about to include community and to care about the economy. We have got to work together. I remain open to working with my Republican colleagues on bipartisan energy security and permitting reform efforts. I hope we can. My colleague, the chairman, knows I want to, but I still do not see this legislative package as a serious proposal. I don't want to be dependent on China more than anybody else does for our batteries, or Russia or any other country. We need to do it in the good ol' USA. We can do it with ingenuity, innovation, technology, and protect our environment at the same time. Mr. Speaker, I am strongly opposed, and I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill."

President Trump imposed a decade-long ban in offshore drilling off the coast of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. Nothing in the underlying bill, H.R. 21, would change that. To be clear, nothing in H.R. 21 affects any existing statutory or regulatory restrictions that may prohibit offshore oil and gas development. The purpose and scope of the bill is limited. It is to protect the SPR from politically motivated drawdowns and to ensure the American people are protected from true emergencies in energy supply disruptions. It would require the Department of Energy to develop a plan. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and the underlying bill, H.R. 21.",
              "this amendment goes further than the scope of H.R. 21. Nothing in H.R. 21 affects any laws or statutes on the books that regulate offshore oil and gas development. The purpose and scope of this bill is limited: it is to protect our SPR from political use and to ensure we are adequately prepared for future legitimate emergencies. It does nothing to impact existing Department of the Interior regulations. It simply requires the Secretary of Energy to develop a plan to increase production if it is used without declaring an emergency. This is not a vehicle to impose new restrictions. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",

The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is put in for strategic reasons for the entire country, not for political gain. This amendment would prohibit oil and gas companies from producing on a lease outlined in the leasing plan unless the fossil industry entity submits to the Secretary of Energy a plan to reduce its global warming pollution. This amendment is simply nothing more than to delay the implementation of H.R. 21. That is all this is. Let's call it what it is. It is not about a few tanks in the country. Really? It is not about that. Americans are suffering under record-high gas prices that hurt low- income Americans the most, and they want to call that, oh, a discussion about a few tanks in the country. Really? Families can't put food on their tables. They can't put gas in their tanks. They are struggling to get by. Oh, this is just a discussion about a few tanks in America, that is all. Mr. Speaker, we have the strongest environmental and safety standards in the world, bar none. Let's let American energy workers do their job, make America safe, and make the world cleaner.

              "it is interesting to hear the comment that apparently I didn't understand the last amendment. Having grown up on the Gulf Coast of Texas, first, Hurricane Carla, in 1961, I went through that. I think I understand the Gulf Coast of Texas, and I think I understand hurricanes. I have been there a long time. So I have to rise in opposition to this amendment. Why? This amendment fails to see that depleting our strategic reserve for nonemergency reasons could actually hurt our ability to help the American people exactly in those times and those events of a real supply interruption like a hurricane or natural disaster. Lord knows I have lived and been through a lot of them. This amendment would jeopardize Americans' energy security and energy jobs in several ways. First, it actually creates a loophole to allow ``test sales,'' Mr. Speaker, of oil out of the strategic reserve to be exempted even when it is not an emergency like we talked about on the Gulf Coast of Texas, my home area. How do we know this? History teaches us a valid lesson. For instance, under this amendment, the Biden administration could abuse its authority by using, again, a ``test sale'' to fund a new government program just like President Obama did in 2014. Second, again, it takes the lawmaking role of Congress and gives it to the executive branch. I have read the Constitution, too. I have read the Constitution. It gives the Department of Energy the power to decide whether the law takes effect. That is unbelievable to me, Mr. Speaker. Finally, even though it ``conditions'' the effective date on a finding by the Department of Energy, the DOE, in no way--in no way-- does it require the Energy Department to make a finding of one way or the other. We could be stuck in limbo for Lord knows how long. This amendment would make the bill worse, and, indeed, it is a poison pill. For this I urge my colleagues to make a ``no'' vote. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "My good friend from Texas apparently did not understand the prior amendment in terms of its utilization in the time of disasters that his district faces as mine does all the time and many other Americans. So let me indicate as I move to No. 36, this is, again, an effort to help Americans and to address the question of the efficiency of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. My amendment would allow the necessary and routine test drawdowns that occur as part of the work to make sure the reserve can fulfill its function of providing access to the resources on a moment's notice in time of emergencies. Those of us in various parts of the Nation understand emergencies. In keeping with our commitment to addressing the core mission of many of us to reduce emissions, we may need a number of tests. Tests are basic to the core mission of the reserve and often involve numbers of barrels or less being drawn down. The Jackson Lee amendment would provide the provisions of this bill should not be triggered by Strategic Petroleum Reserve tests. The Jackson Lee amendment would ensure that tests can continue without delay or suspension out of concern regarding the requirements of the bill so that this Strategic Petroleum Reserve can stand ready to be able to efficiently address what is needed. I am concerned about the direct attack because the CEO--the President of the United States--in the executive article utilizes his powers to help Americans in the midst of a disaster. I hope that this amendment can be accepted by my friends which says that we have to do due diligence on testing. I understand the authors of the bill have a specific policy objective in mind and believe that the bill will accomplish a narrow policy change. However, I would hope that they believe in efficiency, and the utilization of this Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an efficient manner requires tests and drawdowns if we are going to be ready for emergencies to save lives in a crisis that is either heating or otherwise. Again, let me remind my colleagues that we did not hear a word--a Republican word or a Democratic word--when gasoline prices came down. So the executive branch should have the right, if you will, to make those emergency decisions. But to have the ability to test is a reasonable response to ensuring that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve works well every single day that we need to use it. I ask my colleagues to support Jackson Lee amendment No. 36. I will also finish by saying: Please understand what we are saying. Please know that we understand both the legislation and the need for improvement of the legislation. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support amendment No. 36 Jackson Lee, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "Mr. Speaker, today's bill shows that there is no real vision for Republican energy policy. They don't have a path forward. This was their chance to engage meaningfully on energy policy, to set the tone for a new Congress, where we would work together to protect American energy interests. Instead, they are reduced to defending their oil and gas interests and attacking President Biden's successful efforts to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower gas prices for Americans. I have said it before: Republican administrations, Republican Presidents have released oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the past. I am sure that if we had a Republican President now, they would be heralding the fact that he released oil from the reserves in order to bring down gasoline prices at the pump. I want to mention, again, this letter from Secretary Granholm, our Energy Secretary. She states her Department's position on the bill. According to her, this bill would severely restrict or threaten the administration's ability to respond to emergency situations, such as the emergency supply shortage from the one triggered by the war in Ukraine. This bill would not only make it so that gas prices go higher but make it more difficult for us to address supply problems. The Secretary identifies, in my opinion, in irrefutable terms, the Biden administration's successful use of the reserve to lower gas prices for Americans. Now, understand what this bill does. It prohibits the Department of Energy from releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve until it expands oil and gas drilling on Federal lands by the same percentage that it releases oil from the reserve. The previous speaker, Mr. Soto, pointed out that the fossil fuel industry already controls large portions of U.S. public lands and waters, and it isn't using most of it. The problem is not a shortage of leases or land. The problem is a fossil fuel industry more interested in keeping supply artificially low so that prices stay artificially high. They don't want to pump oil because if they do so, then the gas price goes down. That is not what they want. They want to make greater profits. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues, please, the House Republicans are doing the bidding of their Big Oil friends at Americans' expense while threatening the President's ability to take timely actions to lower prices for American consumers at the pump. This bill is a giveaway to Republicans' fossil fuel friends, who already received billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded subsidies and enjoyed record-shattering profits last year at the expense of working families. Releasing oil from the reserve in response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine was a critical, commonsense strategy that helped lower gas prices for American families by a $1.69 per gallon since their peak. Restricting the Federal Government's best tools in the middle of a global energy crisis with no benefit other than increasing the profits of the fossil fuel industry is extreme, and I don't use that word loosely. This bill is an extreme policy that is going to make it so much more difficult for the President to act to deal with the supply chain problems and to try to lower prices for average Americans. It is extreme in the real sense. Mr. Speaker, for that reason, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 21, and I yield back the balance of my time."

              "the bill we are considering today does not protect U.S. consumers, and, instead, it is a giveaway to Big Oil. The fossil fuel industry already controls large swaths of our public lands and our waters. Offshore, the industry already has over 2,000 active leases covering 12 million acres of Federal waters--75 percent of which are not even being used to produce oil and gas. North Carolinians cherish our pristine coastline and rely upon a clean and healthy marine ecosystem to support robust tourism, recreation, and fishing which are vital to our economy. They are the economic lifelines of many of our coastal communities. Elected officials of both parties in North Carolina, up and down the Atlantic Coast as well, ranging from county commissioners to Governors, have expressed staunch opposition to opening our waters to offshore drilling. Putting our coastal economy and environment at risk is the last thing that North Carolinians need, and our neighbors to the north and south agree. Congresswoman Mace, my neighbor to the south, made this same point today. My amendment would take the simple step of preventing the plan required by this bill from including oil and gas leasing in the mid- Atlantic, including my home State of North Carolina. This protects our constituents, our economy, and our environment. I hope that my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, just like people from both sides of the aisle in my State, will listen to their constituents and support this commonsense amendment rather than putting both our environment and our economy at risk. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I rise in strong support of my amendment to H.R. 21. This amendment would ensure that the Federal Government is not forced into leasing public lands with low- or no-potential for oil and gas development to the fossil fuel industry as a result of this bill. The reckless leasing of low- to no-potential lands, also known as speculative leasing, has allowed millions of acres of our Nation's invaluable public lands to be put in harm's way for no real economic benefit in return. The problem is pervasive, affecting all Western States. However, it is particularly severe in my home State of Nevada where there are very few productive oil and gas formations but plenty of Federal land. Speculative leasing is a serious problem that costs taxpayers serious money. These leases are cheap. They are easy to acquire, usually selling at near the minimum bid of $2 per acre. Because they are so cheap, companies with purely speculative interests target these lands with little intent or likelihood of putting them into production. Thus, the government is then forced to use taxpayer dollars to administer and monitor them, but the leases almost never generate royalties or other benefits for the American taxpayer. In fact, according to the GAO, 99 percent of these noncompetitive leases, which are frequently issued with little or no-potential lands, never went into production or generated royalties for taxpayers. In addition to burdening taxpayers, these leases also come with environmental risks. In many instances, low-potential lands receive fewer protections than areas with high potential because Federal land managers forecast low likelihood of development activity. This leaves land, water, and wildlife all incredibly vulnerable. The current policy creates an opportunity cost. Once leased, low- potential lands are not prioritized for other uses like conservation and recreation, regardless of their development status. My amendment will prevent speculative leasing from becoming an even bigger problem. It will exclude Federal lands with no or low potential for oil and gas development from the scope of this bill. My amendment will save taxpayer dollars instead of strong-arming Federal agencies into spending those tax dollars on issuing and administering speculative leases that generate little or no revenue. This means the Federal oil and gas program can more efficiently focus on managing leases that actually generate royalties and revenues for taxpayers. My amendment will mitigate environmental risk. Nearly 50 percent of all leases in the West--spanning 9.9 million acres--are currently idle, with iconic landscapes they encompass frequently left neglected, and the unique cultural and natural resources of these storied places, likewise, are left largely unprotected. This amendment will prevent additional acreage from being put in environmental jeopardy to satisfy leases that half the time are simply left to gather dust. On balance, this amendment reins in the practice that has numerous costs and provides little or no return on investment for us, the American taxpayers. So I implore all of you, Democrats and Republicans, to vote ``yes'' on my amendment, a clear example of commonsense land management and fiscal responsibility. I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment would block this legislation from allowing increased oil and gas leasing on any Federal land where outdoor recreation takes place. Our public lands are for the public, not for the wealthiest industry in the history of the world to drill and to spoil with impunity. Being active in the outdoors and experiencing wild places is a way of life not just in my district but for many communities around this country. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when we were unable to gather the way we liked to indoors, we learned just how important our parks and our public lands are, how getting outside helps our well-being. This is why we must protect and expand our public lands for recreational use, not give them away to a single polluting industry. We all depend on the ecological, economic, and mental health benefits that our public lands provide. That is why my amendment protects these important lands. If we are good stewards, our public lands can simultaneously support a thriving outdoor recreation economy as well as natural resiliency against the climate crisis, all while preserving and protecting these precious lands for future generations. These are the goals of the Biden administration and the State of California in their efforts to protect 30 percent of our lands by 2030 because these lands are meant for everyone to use, enjoy, and pass down to future generations to do the same. However, H.R. 21 would create an arbitrary increase in oil and gas development for the benefit of one single group: the oil and gas industry. This bill may seem simple--it is just three pages long--yet it does something really big and dangerous. It stands to open up over 300 million acres to be destroyed for oil and gas drilling, an area equivalent to three times the size of California or six times the combined size of all our national parks. This is unacceptable, and it is another example of the dangerous extremism we see from this new Republican majority. The fact of the matter is, there are currently 9,000 permits held by the oil and gas industry right now that are not being used. Additionally, the majority of the roughly 26 million acres that are currently under lease to oil and gas companies on our Federal lands and waters are not being used. Industry is simply sitting on them to keep prices artificially high. What would industry do with the dramatic expansion of new leasing opportunities on our valuable public lands? Well, the evidence shows that they will simply lock them up so that they couldn't be used for other activities such as recreation or renewable energy. I represent the north coast of California, and my constituents know the value of public lands for outdoor recreation, from hiking and climbing to kayaking and angling. I hope folks on both sides of the aisle agree that we need to protect the future of these cherished recreational activities on our public lands. Our public lands used for outdoor recreation should not be sacrificed at the altar of Big Oil. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

              "H.R. 21 is really about strengthening the SPR by requiring nonemergency use to be accompanied by a plan to produce American oil resources. Increased supply of American-produced energy lowers costs for all Americans. Energy security provides all communities with reliable, clean, and affordable energy. This is fundamental for our jobs, economic health, and for communities to strive for better opportunities. It reduces energy poverty. Lower-income households pay a higher percentage of their income for energy. Lower costs help everyone. Greater supplies lower costs, and create jobs here in America with American-produced energy resources. This amendment misses the point. It is an unnecessary messaging exercise. Let's focus on results for Americans, American jobs, American energy. I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I think we need to remember that H.R. 21 is about strengthening the SPR by requiring any nonemergency use to be accompanied by a plan to produce American oil resources. This amendment undermines the purpose of the bill. It would deprive the country of the benefits of secure American supplies of cleanly produced fossil energy. We should reject this anti-American energy amendment. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment would prohibit the bill from taking effect until the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with other Federal agencies, certifies that this bill will not result in an increase to the average price of energy for Americans. The world's largest supply of emergency crude oil--the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--was established to reduce the devastating impact of supply shocks on prices. When supply shocks are allowed to occur uninhibited, prices rise, and the American people suffer. Whether it is mile-long lines at your local gas station or home energy costs that force families into the cold or heat, supply shocks in energy markets hurt people. They might not hurt some of my colleagues' neighborhoods, but they certainly hurt mine. My constituents would feel deeply the pain that would happen if the President was not permitted to utilize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to do its job. All too often, affording to keep the lights on is an everyday struggle for my constituents and for many other Americans, as well. My district, the Virgin Islands, has among the highest residential and commercial electric rates in the country. The SPR is one of the few mechanisms that the Federal Government has to prevent ever-growing price pressures from crushing people. Less than 1 year ago, in the face of global crude oil instability following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, President Biden acted with great positive effect to make measured drawdowns from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, causing price reductions by as much as 40 cents per gallon at the pump. Today, average gasoline prices are down by more than $1.50 per gallon from their peak last summer. So the utilization of the SPR thus far to release oil into the market has been very effective for American taxpayers. The SPR is a force for good when it is allowed to operate unencumbered. However, this bill would significantly weaken this critical energy security tool and hamstring the President's ability to utilize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a time of disruption, which will result in more oil supply shortages. It would do so by making it harder to withdraw oil into the market quickly to increase supply when the market needs it most--which will drive up gasoline prices. The President must be able to rapidly provide oil from the SPR to address supply disruptions and respond to emergencies. Arbitrarily requiring the completion of reports related to energy production on Federal lands specifically--a matter which the Department of Energy does not control--would only delay response and increase prices when energy disruptions occur. So my amendment is simple. It provides that SPR utilization may not be limited unless the Secretary of Energy certifies that this would not push up average energy prices in America. Nothing is standing in the way of domestic oil production. Oil production is up by 1 million barrels per day under President Biden and is on track to reach a new record high this year. There are nearly 10,000 approved but unused permits to drill. The basic rules of economics must continue to apply. The SPR should continue to serve as a flexible and responsible emergency supply recourse to put down pressure on energy prices. Under my amendment, this bill must not yield the opposite and raise energy prices. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to please approve my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time."

              "there was some discussion earlier and an allegation made that Democrats have yet to introduce any policy to reduce our energy costs, as if we have completely forgotten about the sweeping, multibillion-dollar investments in the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce people's costs across the board. I am rising today to stand in opposition to H.R. 1. While Republicans try to claim that this is a bill to lower people's energy costs, what we really see when we start digging into it, is that what this bill actually shows us by the Republican authors is that they actually have no plan to reduce our utility bills or even prevent climate disaster in the United States. The central argument and logic of this bill is that if you give Big Oil everything they want, then perhaps they will lower our gas prices. It is a form of trickle-down fantasy that just will not make life easier for everyday Americans. What H.R. 1 will do is give Big Oil more leases of public lands. This idea that an increased supply of fossil fuels will drive down prices is also mistaken. Let's look at what happened last year. We saw how Big Oil more than doubled its profits to $219 billion, all while price gouging customers at the pump, not because of supply issues but because they can. Republicans opposed solutions that we put forward, like a windfall tax on price gouging on Big Oil in order to prevent these kinds of behaviors. Fossil fuel companies, moreover, already have thousands of unused permits on public lands, yet they want even more. This is not a problem of supply. It is a problem of greed and abuse of market power. I, along with many of my colleagues, called for that windfall tax. What does this bill do instead? It is almost as if you gave a pen to an oil lobbyist and wrote down everything that they want. Much of that is in this bill. We are looking at reducing Big Oil's royalty rates to the public and slashing interest fees. For people following at home, if you are a member of the American public, if you are a taxpaying citizen, you are part of the ownership of our public lands. When an oil company decides to lease that land, they are supposed to pay a royalty to the public. What does H.R. 1 do? It slashes that royalty rate so that there is very little payback or investment into the American people and many of our programs. In this bill, Republicans are squarely on the side of fossil fuel companies. It makes it harder for communities to fight Big Oil when they don't want them drilling in their own backyards. It also threatens our public lands and allows anyone to stake a mining claim on our public lands for less than $10 an acre, even if they haven't discovered any minerals. Despite the fact that more than 40 percent of Americans live in counties hit by climate disasters, this bill prohibits agencies from even considering climate change when deciding whether or not to issue a permit to a drilling company. None of these things are going to lower our costs at the pump. None of these things are going to actually reduce our utility bills. In fact, in talking about this allegation of a lack of Democrat proposals, Democrats introduced 95 amendments, proposed 95 amendments to this bill, and the Republican majority rejected all but seven. I, myself, personally sponsored an amendment in the spirit of this bill, allegedly, to try to reduce prices, and my amendment would have made sure that the subsidies that the Federal Government provides to oil and gas companies actually make their way to the American people-- instead of lining the pockets of billionaire CEOs--and actually have the intended effect. Republicans rejected that amendment, too. They have made clear where they stand. I cannot emphasize enough how detrimental and damaging this bill would be, not only to the climate crisis, not only to the purpose of even trying to reduce our utility costs, but moreover, for the ability for the American people to actually receive an investment on the public lands that they lease out.",
              "I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we are here today to consider a rule for H.R. 1, a bill that might as well be called the polluters over people act. It is yet another example of how this majority, instead of helping everyday Americans, is doing the bidding of their deep-pocketed friends. We had another mass shooting yesterday, but Republicans won't lift a finger because of the gun lobby. We had another train derailment this week, but Republicans won't lift a finger because of the polluters. Our planet is on fire, but Republicans won't lift a finger because of Big Oil. Banks are going under, but Republicans want to deregulate more to help their friends on Wall Street. They want to protect kids from what teachers teach in the classroom but not against lead pipes in schools. They say they want to stop inflation but won't go after the billionaire corporations who aren't paying any taxes while they rip people off. Time after time after time, Republicans continue to put politics over people, and it shows. Anyone who spends 2 seconds reading this bill can see that it is a dirty energy, pro-polluter plan that would drag our economy back decades. This bill puts polluters over people. It makes it easier for companies to strip public lands of their resources and harder to hold corporate polluters accountable for the mess they make. It gives more handouts to Big Oil, as if the industry's CEOs and shareholders haven't already raked in enough money with record profits over the last few years. It guts half a century of environmental protections that ensure the air we breathe and the water we drink is clean, and it sets our country back as the rest of the world moves toward a clean energy future. There will be plenty of time for us to talk about all the damage the polluters over people act could do to our country and communities, but let me just highlight a few of the worst. First, it increases the national deficit by half a billion dollars. Considering how much we hear from our colleagues across the aisle about the deficit and the deficit and the deficit, it is fascinating that their most important bill blows a hole in the deficit. So much for their commitment to fiscal discipline. Don't take my word for it, just consult the CBO. It is a little bit ironic on a day that they are asking that there be dramatic cuts in all kinds of programs that help people in this country, they come up with this bill and add close to a half a billion dollars to our deficit. Second, it is a job killer. This bill will kill jobs. Over the last few years, Democrats have invested in building a homegrown, clean energy system so we don't have to rely on foreign cartels like OPEC and greedy Big Oil companies for our energy. Investing in these clean energy projects meant we created millions of clean energy jobs. The polluters over people act would kill these jobs and pull our country off course from our path toward a cleaner, cheaper energy future. Third, it makes it easier to pollute, and it makes it easier for companies to get away with polluting. Just yesterday, a local grandfather in East Palestine, Ohio, detailed the pain caused by the terrible toxic spill there. He said he has ``never cried this much in his life.'' His young granddaughters developed blotches all over their bodies, and their eyes were burning. This bill would mean more billionaire corporations getting away with polluting without being held accountable, more wells with toxic chemicals, more days where windows are shut because the air is not safe to breathe, more kids diagnosed with asthma because the air quality is so poor. The worst part is that the Republicans do not care. Their bill literally puts polluters over the people we are here to serve. It forces American taxpayers to foot the bill for cleanup while billionaire corporations dump their toxic waste on our communities. This is sick. Look at what is happening to our planet, Mr. Speaker. Year after year, the warmest ever recorded; species going extinct at rates not seen in millions of years; sea levels rising and coastal communities feeling the impact; farmers struggling to cope with changing seasons, unprecedented droughts, and crop failures. The answer from my Republican friends is more fossil fuels, more pollution, more drilling, more toxic waste dumped into our communities, more giveaways for Big Oil, and nothing, not a single thing, to lower energy prices. This bill might as well put ExxonMobil and Chevron in charge of our response to climate change. It might as well put Norfolk Southern in charge of chemical safety. It is a terrible bill that will shackle us to dirty fossil fuels for generations to come. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1. The Republicans call it the Lower Energy Costs Act. In fact, it does the opposite, and it puts polluters over people, so we call it the polluters over people act. That is justified because that is exactly what it does. This bill is nothing more than a grab bag of Big Oil giveaways and loopholes that endanger the health, safety, and security of Americans. It does absolutely nothing to lower energy costs for American families. In fact, it will actually drive up costs while doubling down on costly fossil fuels. Now, does the GOP really believe that Big Oil cares about Americans? During the COVID crisis in the last 3 years, we had a hearing where we brought in some of the large oil companies. It was quite clear that they wanted to keep prices high. It was quite clear that they were benefiting from OPEC and the fact that Russia had invaded Ukraine and that oil supplies had become more limited because of that invasion of Ukraine and that as a result, prices for oil and gasoline were going up. They didn't care. They liked it. We actually asked them at the hearing whether or not they would increase production because they have so many leases on Federal lands that they don't use, and they said no. They said maybe eventually they would do that, but they haven't gotten around to it yet. I don't think they have gotten around to it still. So this notion that somehow by benefiting Big Oil, the major American so-called oil companies, that this is going to help the American people, that is not their goal. Last year, Big Oil's profits in 2022 were $451 billion, a record high. The dividends they gave out and the stock buyouts amounted to $163 billion. They only care about the stockholders. They don't care about the price of gasoline. They want it to stay high. They don't care whether Americans can afford gasoline. Chairwoman Rodgers, who I really respect a lot, talked about LNG. One of the things in the bill is it removes the requirement--and I am going to talk about other things it does--but it removes the requirement that liquified natural gas exports be determined to be in the public interest before being sent overseas. That is going to lead to more American LNG being sent to our adversaries, including China. This helps China. This doesn't hurt China. This helps China. We know that there was a time a few years ago when LNG exports were limited because of--I forget what caused it--and during that period of time, the evidence shows the price for American gasoline or American crude was actually going down. When you send LNG overseas, it is not available here in the United States. That actually lowers gas prices when you have more gasoline available or more refineries available to process gasoline here in the United States. I debunk this idea that somehow this bill is going to lower prices here, that somehow benefiting Big Oil benefits Americans, that somehow exporting more LNG hurts China. These things simply are not the case. The evidence proves very much to the contrary. This bill, H.R. 1, I will call it the polluters over people act, rescinds several transformational climate programs that the Democrats enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act last year. What I am trying to get across today is that at the same time that they are helping Big Oil, not driving down prices, and helping China, the Republicans are also tearing down all of the environmental laws that we have had for the last 50 years and putting all the emphasis on fossil fuels rather than clean energy. The bottom line is, the only way that we are going to lower costs is by encouraging clean energy. Yes, I agree with Chairwoman Rodgers that the United States has to be a bigger energy producer, but the future for that is with clean energy, not with pumping more oil and gas. It is by encouraging clean energy because that is where we can be the big producer. That is where the future is. That is where we can outcompete the rest of the world. What does this bill do? It foolishly repeals the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which invests in high-impact projects that reduce pollution, creates good-paying clean energy jobs, and improves public health. They obviously do not want to do anything for clean energy. It also repeals the methane emissions reduction program, which protects the health of our communities and ensures that polluters, not taxpayers or customers, pay for wasted methane. Let me use that as an example. I want everyone to understand that when we passed the Inflation Reduction Act and we were trying to cut back on greenhouse gases which lead to global climate problems and the increase in global warming, we worked hard to deal with those industries here that could be affected. The Methane Emissions Reduction Act is a perfect example that we worked with the independent oil producers because they said, well, if you cause the methane that is wasted now and goes into the atmosphere and causes this increased number of greenhouse gases, if you work with us, we can accomplish capturing this methane and then it can be recycled, but we need some money to accomplish that. We provided them with a fund so they could make that transition. We also said that if it took them time to get a permit to capture the gas and provide a recycling program for the methane, that they would not be penalized by doing that. This has been characterized by the GOP as some sort of tax or fee on the industry. It is really a penalty if they don't do what is necessary to capture methane and avoid it going into the atmosphere. The same is true for almost every provision that they seek to repeal here. These are provisions that try to protect the public health, reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but at the same time don't have a negative impact on those industries that are hiring people and that create jobs. At the same time, try to move toward new clean energy things like wind, solar, and more hydropower, and other things that actually do create more jobs, as we have proven that they have. There are so many other things that repeal--I won't go through all of them because I know that we have other speakers. The bill also repeals the popular home electrification rebates that are specifically designed to lower energy bills for American families. These are popular incentives that will save families money and are urgently needed to help us fight the climate crisis. Republicans are rejecting all these things that help people save money, help reduce greenhouse gases so they can double-down on the old pro-polluter policies that they have had for years. This bill also does nothing to meaningfully address permitting reform. Its vision of permitting consists of letting polluters do whatever they want, and instead, the bill becomes a sweetheart deal. The bill, for example, doesn't include any changes to the transmission policy necessary to ensure that clean energy can reach all corners of the country. Let me also give you a couple of other examples. The biggest thing that they do to basically endanger all of our environmental protections is they exempt so-called critical energy resources from the Clean Air Act and hazardous waste permitting requirements. They say if we label a refinery or if we label a utility as a critical energy resource, then they don't have to follow the Clean Air Act, they don't have to follow the Clean Water Act, and they don't have to follow the Hazardous Waste Act. It is a roundabout way of saying that we are just going to let all these industries do whatever they want, even though it undercuts public health protections. They do the same thing with toxic chemicals. We had a major toxic chemical bill to try to cut back on toxic chemicals that needlessly expose families and children to health risks. They basically get rid of that by saying, oh, those facilities don't have to worry about releasing toxic chemicals. Mr. Speaker, I end by saying this. Democrats understand that the transition to clean energy is important. In fact, projects already underway are valued at tens of billions of dollars and have already created more than 100,000 good-paying jobs. Our Inflation Reduction Act is estimated to create 9 million new jobs over the coming decade and reduce energy costs by an average of $1,800 per year. What we have done in the last few years as Democrats is to try to move toward clean energy, understanding that you still have to have fossil fuels and nuclear and other things, but understanding that the future in terms of the U.S. being a major energy producer is in clean energy, not in fossil fuels. To just wreck and put a bulldozer through all our environmental protections in order to encourage fossil fuels is just a huge mistake. It is not going to lower energy costs. It is going to make it much more difficult for us to reduce greenhouse gases and all the negative impacts of climate change. There is nothing in here. In my opinion, this bill is also going to hurt us from a national security point of view because it does actually help China and help our adversaries rather than making it more difficult for them to compete with us. Mr. Speaker, I would urge opposition to the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time."

              "my amendment would prevent any new oil and gas production under the proposed plan if those activities will have a negative effect on the air quality. I am a strong proponent of efforts to lower energy costs, promote energy independence, and create a stronger, more secure economy. I recognize this will take a multifaceted approach, but it must include more investment in renewable energy sources and a smart transition away from oil and gas. The fact is, for the past couple of decades the Federal Government has issued far more drilling permits than oil and gas companies have acted upon. Nearly 80 percent of offshore oil is in areas that are already open for exploration, according to the National Resources Defense Council. Oil and gas drilling is a dirty business, and we should think long and hard before we invite more of it on our Federal lands. Drilling releases several pollutants that are making our air more smoggy and more dirty and harmful to breathe. The toxic particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, ozone, and volatile organic compounds released by oil and gas drilling can lead to many poor health outcomes, including premature births, asthma, and heart disease. It is often low-income and minority communities that bear the brunt of these awful effects. We should continue the work of the Inflation Reduction Act and create a new clean energy economy and not move backward with an empty political gesture that will ultimately do little to address oil and gas prices and our energy security and independence. I might note that Exxon did a study in the early 1970s on these issues, and their scientists found that what has occurred with fossil fuels and the effect on our climate and our air was accurately predicted 50 years ago, but they didn't release it. It has been found that what they predicted was almost exact, 50 years ago, on what this would do to our world climate, but they didn't release it. We must protect our environment and the health of our current and future generations from the toxic effects of fossil fuel production. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I rise to offer an amendment that would prevent this oil giveaway from further burdening communities of color, low-income communities, Tribal, and indigenous communities. Over the past several years our late colleague, Representative McEachin and I traveled the country to hear from environmental justice and frontline communities across this Nation about pollution and climate impact. We heard the tales of water not fit to drink, air not fit to breathe, and communities not safe to live in. For too long we have allowed the vulnerable to bear the impacts of development, leaving them to pay the costs that are incurred. We must change that narrative by ensuring that these communities are at the decisionmaking table and that their voices are clearly heard at every level of government. This was a legacy my dear friend and our late colleague dedicated his life to, and that is why I am proud that we will be renaming the Environmental Justice For All Act in his honor in the next several weeks. Unfortunately, the bill in front of us today would take us further than ever from achieving environmental justice and attention to frontline communities. There is no way to open up 300 million acres to new extraction without massively impacting communities of color, low- income communities, and Tribal and indigenous communities. These already-impacted communities would face additional pollution of their air and water, additional impacts on their health and that of their children. My amendment seeks to avoid these unacceptable impacts, preventing the Secretaries from leasing any land that would continue to increase disproportionate burdens on already burdened communities. We must stop putting pollution over people and put an end to the cycles of exploitation that leave the most vulnerable facing avoidable impacts. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support the environmental justice amendment and to vote ``yes'' on this amendment. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 21, which would prevent increased drilling on Federal lands under this act until the Secretary of Energy certifies that it would not perpetrate environmental injustice. Let me just thank, first of all, Ranking Member Pallone for his leadership and support in advancing this amendment. My amendment is very simple. It prohibits increases in the percentage of Federal lands leased for oil and gas production under this act, if that new drilling would perpetuate environmental injustice. Environmental justice is the right to a safe, healthy, productive, and sustainable environment for all, regardless of race, class, income, or background. For too long, we have overlooked the impact of environmental issues on underserved communities in this country. EPA data shows that people of color are much more likely to live near polluters and breathe polluted air. For instance, asthma, which is often caused by a particular pollution, impacts approximately 13.4 percent of African- American children, compared to only 7.3 percent of White children. But all low-income people and communities, and especially in poor communities, all communities deserve to be safe from environmental health impacts, and people of all races confront environmental injustice. Rural communities are also adversely impacted by mining pollution and contaminated air and groundwater. Environmental injustices impact all of us; from urban centers to rural regions. In my home State of California, we are experiencing the climate emergency firsthand. We know that these unprecedented fires are driven by climate change. Preventing harmful oil and gas drilling, especially when it harms those already most vulnerable, will help get us back on the path to justice. This amendment builds off of the A. Donald McEachin, our beloved late colleague, his Environmental Justice for All Act, that I am proud to co-lead with Ranking Member Grijalva, which sets the stage to begin addressing the long history of environmental racism and injustice in the United States. Mr. Speaker, this fight for environmental justice is also very personal for me. I was born and raised in El Paso, Texas, under the shadow of the smokestacks of the Asarco copper smelter. Myself, my friends, my neighbors, we were constantly exposed to toxic chemicals. I watched so many people close to me, including family members, suffer with major health challenges because of lead that spewed from that plant. In the 1970s, the CDC found that 62 percent of children under 10 living near the plant where I lived had toxic levels of lead in their blood. Even after the smelter was shut down, I think it was, like, 2013, it took decades before any of the residents harmed saw any sort of justice. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article titled: ``Before Flint, Before East Chicago, There Was Smeltertown.'' [From NRDC, Nov. 29, 2016] Before Flint, Before East Chicago, There Was Smeltertown (By Lauren Villagran) After a 1970s CDC study showed that the mostly Mexican- American population of this Texas town had dangerously high blood lead levels, its buildings were demolished and its residents were booted. The Smelter Cemetery sits high atop a desert arroyo between Interstate 10 and the Mexican border in El Paso. Its wind- worn wooden crosses are almost all that remain of a community that sprang up more than a century ago next to an Asarco lead smelter on the banks of the Rio Grande. The stone-pile graves bear testament to the history of this place called Smeltertown. At one time it was a village of more than 2,500 people, most of them Mexican immigrants who built their lives on company land in the shadow of the smelter's smokestacks that would poison their air, their land, and their children. And almost as soon as the contamination became known in the 1970s, the community of Smeltertown was erased: its buildings demolished, its people forced out. Now, the men and women who lived and worked in Smeltertown, their children, and their children's children reunite each year. Many still live in El Paso, in neighborhoods that cropped up as Smeltertown was torn down. Others travel from California, the East Coast, and abroad. They come together to reweave the social fabric of Smeltertown by sharing memories and retelling stories they all know by heart. They celebrate their old hometown despite the dangers it posed to their families. Seminal research done on Smeltertown in the 1970s by the Centers for Disease Control found that 62 percent of children 10 and under living within one mile of the smelter had blood lead levels considered to be ``evidence of undue lead absorption.'' The residents of Smeltertown would be the first American community to face the grim prospect of lead exposure and its consequences--but they wouldn't be the last. The communities of Flint, Michigan, the West Calumet Housing Complex in East Chicago, Indiana, and the schools in Newark, New Jersey, are just three of the most recent examples. But the CDC estimates that at least half a million children in the United States have elevated blood lead levels--and many of them may not even know it. A Company Town The American Smelting and Refining Company owned a smelter in El Paso that, starting in 1910, refined hundreds of thousands of tons of lead and copper harvested from its mines in Mexico. It did so with the help of ``an army of Mexican contract workers,'' according to University of Houston associate professor of history Monica Perales in her book Smeltertown: Making and Remembering a Southwest Border Community. Mexican workers who labored in Asarco mines began migrating north, lured by that new operation on the U.S. side of the border. Many settled on company land below the foothills of Mt. Cristo Rey. In the early years of the 20th century, Smeltertown lay outside El Paso city limits, a few miles from the city's downtown. Divided into an upper section, El Alto, where the Anglo managers lived, and a lower section, El Bajo, where the Mexican workers lived, Smeltertown had its own post office, butcher shop, bakery, cantinas, a theater, San Jose Catholic parish, a YMCA, a public elementary school, and the Smelter Vocational School. Smeltertown was a quintessential company town, in which the company could be both benefactor and tyrant. Former residents say Asarco paid well, better than many other employers of the working class. And yet poverty in Smeltertown could be extreme. Residents built and invested in their homes, but the company owned the land; few families could afford cars; many relied on outhouses into the 1960s. ``As in other single- industry towns, Smeltertown's residents fashioned their own way of life in the world the company made, one marked by inequality, racial segregation, and corporate paternalism,'' Perales writes. The community would flourish for 70 years under the plumes of the smelter's twin smokestacks, ignorant of the pervasive danger. ``A Silent Poison'' In March 1971, a team of Epidemic Intelligence Service officers from the CDC arrived to investigate lead exposure connected to the Asarco smelter. Dr. Bernard Rosenblum, the El Paso City-County health commissioner, had called the CDC after his department discovered that Asarco was discharging large quantities of lead and other metallic wastes into the air. Between 1969 and 1971, the smelter's stacks had spewed more than 1,000 tons of lead, 560 tons of zinc, 12 tons of cadmium, and 1.2 tons of arsenic into the atmosphere. Soil studies showed the highest concentrations of lead and other metals in surface soil closest to the smelter--essentially, in Smeltertown. The city of El Paso was suing Asarco on the basis of those findings alone, but Rosenblum wanted to know more. He was worried about the health of the kids. (OnEarth made several attempts to reach Asarco and its parent company, Grupo Mexico, for comment without success.) The CDC team, led by a 29-year-old pediatrician named Philip Landrigan, began to explore a subject about which precious little was known: lead toxicity, especially its effects on children. Landrigan, now a pediatrician and epidemiologist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, says, ``The notion that lead could be toxic at lower levels was extremely new at that time. Up until 1970 and continuing for years, people believed you didn't have to worry about lead unless it was so high that it made a child seriously sick. The whole idea that lead in the body could be a silent poison was a new concept.'' Landrigan and the CDC team first looked at whether environmental contamination would be reflected in human blood lead levels over three months. The results were startling: Although they found no cases of overt lead poisoning, 43 percent of people in all age groups and 62 percent of children 10 and under living within one mile of the smelter had blood lead levels of at least 40 micrograms per deciliter. That's eight times the level at which the CDC recommends a full-fledged public health response today. Landrigan quickly followed up with a second study in Smeltertown in 1972, examining the health consequences of lead exposure in children. The CDC team administered IQ tests and a finger-tapping test of physical reflexes to the Smeltertown kids with elevated blood levels; a control group of children with blood lead levels below 40 micrograms per deciliter was also tested. The study found that children with elevated blood lead levels tested as many as seven points lower on the IQ test than the control group; they also showed much slower reaction times on the physical reflexes test."

              "before I discuss the details of my amendment, I want to applaud the new Republican majority for giving Members the opportunity to offer amendments in a more open process. The people's House has been broken for far too long, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in an open process for the remainder of this Congress. I also want to thank Chairwoman McMorris-Rodgers for her leadership on this issue to put American energy first. I cosponsored this legislation because I believe it puts America back on track to regain energy independence. This is such an important issue and critical piece of legislation that I believe we cannot stop short. We need to chart a path back to energy independence and ensure President Biden is not able to sell our critical oil supplies to China or any other rogue nation. President Biden used emergency authorities to sell hundreds of millions of barrels of oil to our enemies. My amendment would prevent President Biden from claiming an emergency to further reduce our strategic oil supplies. This is why I filed impeachment articles last Congress against President Biden on the grounds that he endangered, compromised, and undermined the energy security of the United States by selling oil from the United States' Strategic Petroleum Reserve to foreign nations. President Biden has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to the national security of our country. No President in the history of the United States has ordered a liquidation of the SPR on this scale. He sold 40 percent of our critical oil supply to trick and deceive the American people before the election. Rather than unleashing American energy here at home, he has robbed our country. When President Biden took office in 2021, the SPR contained 638 million barrels of oil. Since then, he has slashed our oil inventory to 371 million barrels. He has decimated the SPR to the lowest level since December, 1983, before some Members of this body were even born. He shredded the offers from oil companies to resupply the reserve. He gave away 7 million barrels of our oil to a Communist Chinese state-run energy firm. The CCP had 1.2 billion barrels when Biden took office, they have even more now. I cannot believe our President did that. If we let President Biden continue to run our oil this way, we will have nothing left. This has destroyed America's oil production. President Biden shut down the Keystone XL pipeline, destroying hundreds of thousands of American jobs. President Biden has allowed the least amount of federal land for drilling since the end of World War II. We are now producing 1 million barrels of oil less every day compared to when President Trump was in office. Every country faces natural disasters. Where will we get our oil next time we are in crisis? Whom will we have to beg to get our oil? China? Iran? The Saudis? Venezuela--like the Biden administration has already done? Or maybe even Russia? President Biden's actions prove an intentional plot to destroy America's oil industry and usher in the climate cult's Green New Deal. My amendment would simply strike the exceptions that Biden used to sell our oil. The American people don't believe that the President should have the authority to declare an emergency for any reason and then sell our oil to our enemies. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "as Congress considers reforms to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, I rise once again to urge my colleagues to close a dangerous loophole that has existed since 2015, which allows our foreign adversaries to purchase our strategic oil supply. As the law is currently written, oil from the SPR is sold by the Department of Energy to our highest bidders with little exceptions on what countries can purchase the U.S. supply. That means that our fiercest adversaries like China and also Russia, Iran, and North Korea and other sanctioned governments can purchase and export our strategic oil. In fact, Chinese-owned and affiliated companies have won purchase contracts during the past Presidential administrations. Simply put, this loophole is threatening to our national security. It poses threats to our American families. The American people need to act quickly. That is why, 2 weeks ago, I reached across the aisle to reintroduce a bill that my colleague, Representative Don Bacon, and I have that addresses this issue. It is called the Banning Oil Exports to Foreign Adversaries Act. This bill is straightforward, and it is common sense. It prohibits the export or sale of the SPR to China, North Korea, Russia, Iran, and any country currently under U.S. sanctions. Last week, my colleagues and I voted to pass a bill through the House that would prohibit the sale of our reserve to China, but that legislation does not go far enough. Do we want North Korea buying oil? How about Iran or Russia? It is clear that this bill remains the most comprehensive and bipartisan policy that has been put forward, and it now has more than 60 bipartisan cosponsors. As a veteran and one of the most bipartisan Members of this body, my position remains clear: We need to put our national security over party politics. We have to ensure that our foreign adversaries are not allowed to profit at the expense of America and our safety and security. I thank Mr. Gottheimer for his support for this legislation as an original cosponsor. This amendment we are speaking of right now reflects the fact that Congress has so much more work to do to close this loophole. I urge our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, to support the bipartisan Banning Oil Exports to Foreign Adversaries Act. Let's send this legislation through in proper order, strengthen it, and work together to get it signed into law. Once again, I thank Mr. Gottheimer for his commitment to this cause.",
              "while there is a great deal of divisive and partisan debate on the energy bill that is being considered this week, I rise to offer a bipartisan, commonsense, and straightforward amendment to protect U.S. national security in times of energy crisis.

In fact, companies owned by and affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party have won purchase contracts during the past two Presidential administrations.

That is why I reached across the aisle to introduce the Banning Oil Exports to Foreign Adversaries Act with my colleague, Representative Don Bacon.

              "frankly, I have no idea why this amendment is being offered. It would force the Department of Energy to ride the roller coaster that is the oil future's market, without any option to just pay a simple fixed price for a barrel of oil. If oil goes up $20 per barrel between when DOE purchases oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and when it is delivered, well, that is too bad. We are now paying $20 per barrel more, and we will have to buy less oil. This amendment unnecessarily restrains DOE and makes purchasing petroleum products to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve more expensive. DOE recognized as much when it issued a rulemaking last fall clarifying that it could purchase oil at a fixed price, as common sense would dictate. There is no reason that it should be illegal for the Department of Energy to sign a contract saying that it will purchase oil for $70 per barrel. No reason that I can think of. Except, of course, if you are an oil company that wants the Department of Energy to pay more to refill the reserve. However, if you are an average American, then this amendment is a raw deal. It constrains the Department of Energy's usage of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is partially responsible for the tremendous over $1.50 per gallon fall in the cost of gasoline we have seen since last summer's peak gas prices. I will note that when the Department of Energy issued its notice of proposed rulemaking this last summer, industry did not object. In fact, the Department of Energy only received one comment on the rulemaking from Employ America, which was unambiguously positive. That comment stated that the rule change ``is an important step to reduce the volatility of oil prices over the short and medium term, improve our Nation's energy security, and a necessary step to ensure that acquisition procedures more fully align with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve's governing statute.'' This amendment will put the usage of index pricing on par with the Department of Energy's duty to acquire petroleum products for the reserve as cheaply as possible. I don't understand that mission. It will only serve to diminish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "American gas prices are too high. The pressure is on this Congress to do something about it. President Biden has done something about it by releasing oil at a strategic time from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and gas prices are down from their peak. But Americans want more. They want real action, and instead, they get what is nothing more than a 2-day fraud on this House floor: a bill that would do absolutely nothing to reduce oil prices or gas prices. Yet, by spending 2 days on the floor and by making this the bill of the week, we fool the American people into thinking that Congress is doing something. Now, how utterly meaningless is this bill? It would do nothing to increase oil production in the United States for it calls only for a plan to be created but not necessarily implemented. It implies that it would do something to increase oil production but not for well more than a year after the crisis began any spike in oil prices. Finally, even if more oil is produced in the United States, it will be exported and will lower the world price perhaps by a penny. This is a messaging bill. Its message is to attack President Biden, who is the only one who has actually done something to reduce oil prices. So let's look at what this bill does. It calls for a plan. If the administration wants to give us a plan, then give us a plan. Washington is filled with plans. The American Petroleum Institute has a plan. Everybody has a plan. So we draft another plan. What does that do? Now, it forces the administration to write a plan about leasing more land for oil drilling. They are free to list parcels where everybody knows there is no oil and nobody wants to bid. If they don't want to do a plan, then that is the plan they will give us. But let's say they give us the plan that the majority seems to want. They can write the plan, accompany it with a letter explaining that they think it won't reduce oil prices and that it is bad for the environment, and therefore they are not going to implement it. So now we have a plan that is similar to what they want and a letter saying why it won't be implemented. This is what we offer the American people? If we are going to have a bill that requires a plan, then we ought to adopt this amendment that offers the administration a chance to create a different kind of plan, a plan to prohibit or limit exports. The illustration of how important this is can be seen just north of our border. Canada produces twice as much oil as they consume, and their consumers are paying $2 a gallon more than we are paying. So producing more oil inside your country doesn't seem to lower oil prices for those living to the north of the United States. Why? Because the oil is simply exported at the world price. Now, that guarantees--if we actually produced more oil in the United States and exported it--more profits for oil companies but not a penny of reduction at the pump. If instead we had a plan to limit or prohibit exports, then we would lower certainly the price of natural gas, and I believe that under many circumstances we would reduce the price of oil and gasoline paid for by the American people. So the majority comes to this floor with a bill requiring a plan to be added to the hundreds of existing plans that already exist that requires the administration to create a plan that the majority tells us the administration doesn't want to create, allows the administration to create a plan that they wouldn't like, allows the administration to create a plan that they would like and then refuse to implement it, and then tells the American people that they are doing something to lower the price of gasoline now. Let's point out that we are going to produce more oil in this country in 2023 than any other year in our history. So this is a message bill that is sending a false message. We are going to produce more oil in 2023 than any other year. But even if we did lease more land, and even if they did drill on it, that is a response that might affect us in 2025. Why don't we have something that will lower gas prices now? So if we want to engage in this process of telling the American people that we are doing something or that we would do something but it is the other party's fault, then for God's sakes, bring forward a bill that if enacted--which, of course, won't happen--but if enacted, that would actually do something. This bill will not increase oil production in the United States, and oil production in the United States, if exported, will do nothing to help the American consumer. Mr. Speaker, vote for my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 21. Once again, House Republicans are showing their true colors--bringing a bill to the floor that helps their Big Oil friends and hurts hardworking Americans. This is a reckless and extreme bill. It will hamstring the single most important tool the Biden administration has used to fight Putin's price hike on gasoline. The chairwoman mentioned affordability, but by releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the Biden administration helped bring down gas prices by over $1.50 per gallon. Republicans call that politicizing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I call that providing real relief to the American people at the gas pump. Again, Democrats are addressing affordability trying to bring down high gas prices; and now, after promising to lower costs for American families, House Republicans want to pass this bill that will raise gas prices at the pump. Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what this bill would do. It would prevent the Department of Energy from using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to respond to price hikes until Big Oil is given open access to drill on public lands. Restricting the Federal Government's best tool for decreasing gas prices in the middle of a global energy crisis defies any logic. After all, this is a tool that administrations of both parties--Democrat and Republican--have successfully used in the past. It is baffling to me to see Republicans oppose President Biden's release of oil from the reserve considering that in recent years, Republican administrations withdrew even more due to oil sales that they themselves mandated when they were in control of Congress. House Republicans have also used the reserve as a piggy bank to withdraw nearly 300 million barrels of oil to pay for their priorities. Yet now they want to feign outrage that President Biden withdrew fewer barrels to lower prices at the pump. This is not serious legislation, Mr. Speaker, but instead a political stunt. Republicans are just upset that President Biden stood up and actually used all the tools at his disposal to fight back against high gas prices for American families. This bill actually fights against American families and against addressing affordability. The Secretary of Energy was clear in a letter she wrote to Chair Rodgers and me last week. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the text of that letter. The Secretary of Energy, Washington, DC, January 18, 2023. Hon. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Chair, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr., Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Chair Rodgers and Ranking Member Pallone: Congratulations again on your re-elections to Congress and selections as Chair and Ranking Member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. I look forward to working closely with you in the 118th Congress. I write to express the Department of Energy's serious concerns about H.R. 21, the Strategic Production Response Act. From responding swiftly to natural disasters to executing a historic release of oil in response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the Administration's use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has been critical to ensuring adequate oil supply and lowering gasoline prices for American families. This bill would significantly weaken this critical energy security tool, resulting in more oil supply shortages in times of crisis and higher gasoline prices for Americans. Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine created the worst global energy crisis in decades. The President took unprecedented action with allies and partners, releasing oil from our strategic reserves, to stabilize global oil supply and gasoline prices. We have heard directly from industry over the last several months that these actions were essential to maintaining supply. And Americans see the results for themselves at the pump. Today, gasoline prices are down by $1.70 per gallon from their peak this summer. In fact, gasoline prices are now below where they were before Russia's invasion. That was far from a foregone conclusion a year ago. The Treasury Department estimates that the Administration's SPR actions reduced prices for American consumers at the pump by as much as 40 cents per gallon. In addition to saving Americans money, the SPR releases should provide a good deal for taxpayers, by selling oil at a high price, with a planned refill of the SPR at lower prices. If enacted, H.R. 21 would make it harder to take such action quickly to increase supply when the market needs it most--driving up prices during crises. H.R. 21 would significantly interfere with the United States' ability to release oil collectively through the International Energy Agency during an emergency supply shortage, as was done in early March 2022. And H.R. 21 would severely restrict the Department's ability to lend oil when disruptions occur due to natural disasters or pipeline outages. Just last month, when the Keystone Pipeline was suddenly shut down, refiners in Texas and Louisiana were sent scrambling to keep facilities running. This Administration--like those of both parties have previously--quickly lent out oil to help maintain operations, avoid shortages, and prevent further price spikes. H.R. 21 would undermine our ability to take such decisive action in response to future disruptions. I believe it is essential that the SPR can continue to address supply disruptions by rapidly providing oil in response to emergencies. Arbitrarily requiring the completion of reports related to energy production on Federal lands--a matter which the Department of Energy does not control--would only delay such critical action and increase prices for Americans when energy disruptions occur. Today, there is nothing standing in the way of domestic oil production. In fact, oil production is up by 1 million barrels per day under President Biden and is on track to reach a new record high this year. Oil and gas companies are currently sitting on approximately 9,000 approved but unused permits to drill, and billions in record profits. They do not need another giveaway. I appreciate your consideration of these concerns, and I hope we can work together on strategies to ensure American energy productivity, security, and affordability. Sincerely, Jennifer M. Granholm."

              "in 2019, the United States became energy independent for the first time in 62 years. However, on his first day in office, President Biden destroyed American energy production by killing the Keystone XL pipeline and outsourcing our energy needs to our enemies. President Biden's energy policies not only hurt our families at the pump, but they also threaten our national security. That is why I have introduced an amendment to H.R. 1, my Defend America's Rural Energy Act, to defend our farmers and energy producers from foreign adversary land grabs. My amendment would specifically prohibit China from buying farmland suitable for ethanol and biodiesel production, which is vital to the rural American economy. Honoring our Commitment to America, Republicans will end Biden's war on American energy and fulfill another promise to the American people, and that is keeping American land in the hands of the American farmer. Mr. Speaker, I am a passionate supporter of H.R. 1.",
              "plain and simple, plain and simple, this amendment is unnecessary and misguided and, not to mention, oh, it strikes the whole bill. Maybe a lesson is needed for our friends across the aisle. The United States is the world's largest energy producer, in case y'all didn't know that; and combined with our allies, Canada and Mexico, North America is the world's largest energy superpower. Our network of pipelines, production platforms, and refineries span our borders, providing the American people with energy security that is absolutely unmatched around the world. Let me repeat that: Absolutely unmatched around the world. Our refineries along the Gulf Coast, which I have the third upper part of the Gulf Coast in the State of Texas, are the most complex and technically advanced in the entire world, bar none. We take crude oil of all grades from around the world and make valuable fuels and refined products that actually drive our entire economy. This amendment would cut off a valuable source of energy, just like when President Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline. I think I heard them say that they were about helping American workers, and how many jobs were lost when he canceled the Keystone pipeline. For that reason, Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment because it will make America less energy secure, the exact opposite purpose of H.R. 21, the bill before us. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act. Let me be clear, a vote for H.R. 1 is a vote for food security. Let me repeat that. A vote for H.R. 1 is a vote for food security. Let me explain. As chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, and proud Representative from Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District, I am no stranger to the challenges facing America's energy industry and its direct impact on farming communities. In fact, the Commonwealth showcases the nexus between energy and agriculture production each and every day. Pennsylvania is home to abundant natural resources from Marcellus shale natural gas play to America's first commercial oil well. These are responsibly developed resources that have provided energy affordability to our Nation for generations and transformed the U.S. into a global economic powerhouse. These resources have also helped spur our State's largest industry-- agriculture. And just like any other region of the country, the viability of our ag sector is relying upon access to abundant and affordable energy. By gambling away American energy independence and domestic oil and gas production in the name of climate change, the Biden administration has harmed the very industry--U.S. agriculture--that contributes to 13 percent of our annual greenhouse gas sequestration. The hardworking men and women who feed and fuel our Nation in the world are, in reality, climate heroes. Even still, this administration has continued to take irrational regulatory and policy actions that foster uncertainty and limit our ability to meet the food, fiber, and energy demands of our Nation and the world. This legislation provides a reprieve for America's families, including our farmers, ranchers, and foresters, who have struggled with fractured supply chains, skyrocketing input costs, and historic levels of inflation, all of which are exacerbated by excessive spending and regulatory overreach from Washington. American agriculture, if given the right tools and regulatory certainty, can serve a vital role in alleviating global food instability and mitigating costs for consumers. H.R. 1 provides this certainty and will deliver long-lasting relief for nearly every sector of the U.S. economy. As I have always said, food security is national security. We need dependable local power generation, adequate infrastructure, a strong workforce, and lower energy costs for farm operations to remain viable. It is time we return to embracing American energy, not abandon it, and in doing so, enable America's agriculture sector to thrive. House Republicans made a commitment to an economy that is strong. Through H.R. 1, we are upholding that promise."

              "I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1. It is a very shortsighted, anti-science, anti-environment, and anti-family bill. Last week, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its synthesis report and reminded us how urgent it is that we transition to a zero-carbon economy now. We need new clean energy, and we need it fast. There is an opportunity for Congress to engage on permitting and transmission so new energy projects, especially clean energy projects, can get up and running as soon as possible. However, instead of a meaningful conversation, H.R. 1 is a sad regurgitation of the majority's bill from the 115th Congress with attacks on the Inflation Reduction Act. Transmission conversations are completely absent, yet we know that investment in transmission is key to our energy future. This bill will repeal important programs to help Americans make their homes energy efficient. These popular programs are already in motion to help families lower energy costs, and this bill will take them away. H.R. 1 reduces the fees and royalties for oil and gas development, padding the pockets of oil and gas at a time when their record profits are at an all-time high. This is not about energy prices for American families but profits for fossil fuel companies at exactly the time when the whole world knows we need to move away from them as quickly as possible. On the one hand, my Republican friends are so concerned with the deficit that they are holding the economy hostage over their brinkmanship on the debt limit. Then, on the other hand, they bring a partisan bill to the floor that the Congressional Budget Office said will increase that deficit by $2\\1/2\\ billion. I implore my Republican colleagues to take the deficit seriously and pass a clean debt limit. Please take our energy needs seriously and our climate seriously and work with us on our transmission needs. We are interested in the discussions. Our door is open when you want to work with us to get things done and move past partisan messaging bills that will be dead on arrival in the 60-vote Senate.",
              "I thank Chairman Westerman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to support H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, to increase energy production, export American energy, and build out our infrastructure to transport it. All of our constituents have seen and felt the impact of the constraint on and the cost of energy. Sadly, we don't have to go too far to see the impact of this administration's efforts to harm domestically produced energy. From the cancelation of the Keystone XL pipeline, a moratorium of oil and gas leases on Federal lands, and the self-destruction of our offshore lease programs, it is hard to imagine just how far this administration will go to prop up unrealistic, utopian ideas--utopian ideas that a country could solely exist on wind and solar without oil and gas. By the way, there is a whole lot of information on wind and solar that doesn't get advertised all that much: the fact that the materials necessary to build those components come from mining that we have largely prevented ourselves from doing and have to import from overseas, the cost of the transmission, and the fact that those rotors on the wind turbines need fossil fuels to continue to operate. Nevertheless, that is the evangelism we have been given by the current administration. Americans are paying the price for this utopian future, and they are paying it right now. With this just transition to other forms of unreliable energy, the cost is borne by the most vulnerable among us. That is why Republicans are leading the way to unleash the full potential of American energy through H.R. 1. H.R. 1 means no more begging the Saudis for oil, ignoring the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, and forgoing American workers, industry, and expertise. H.R. 1 means abundant energy for all Americans in an environmentally responsible way. Republicans are also leading the way with all forms of energy. That is why I am thankful for the inclusion of my CLEAN Act in H.R. 1 to promote the responsible exploration of geothermal resources on Federal lands. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Westerman for his leadership, and I look forward to the passage of H.R. 1.",
              "this shouldn't be a controversial topic and, my hope is that folks on both sides of the aisle will be able to support this commonsense amendment. House Democrats should support this amendment because it provides the White House increased flexibility to tap more oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when necessary. House Republicans should support this amendment because this modest 5 percent increase in flexibility for the SPR also allows a modest 5 percent increase to responsibly produce American energy on Federal lands through the plan required by this bill. Having said that, this amendment doesn't mandate increased energy production. It just slightly modifies the cap. If the White House still only wants to utilize 10 percent from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and only wants the increase in Federal energy production on Federal lands to be 10 percent, this amendment still allows that flexibility. It is far past time we stopped begging foreign dictators to produce oil and gas for America. America makes the cleanest energy in the world. In fact, our natural gas is 42 percent cleaner than Russian natural gas. American innovation has allowed America to be the global leader in reducing emissions since the year 2000. We should be producing the energy Americans need right here in the good old U.S. of A. Yet, on President Biden's watch, we have seen a 40 percent increase in gas prices. In order to help combat their significantly flawed energy strategy, the White House raided the Strategic Petroleum Reserves by more than 40 percent. My amendment prevents this type of abuse while slightly increasing the amount of oil that can be drawn from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve during an actual emergency like President Trump did. The root causes of this record-breaking inflation were trillions of dollars of wasteful spending federally and unnecessary attacks on American energy. The Biden administration waged an all-out war on American energy production. Biden shut down the Keystone XL pipeline on day one of his administration, imposed new rules to block pipeline projects, canceled oil and gas leases on millions of acres in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico, suspended oil drilling leases in a small sliver of ANWR, even though Congress passed a law for this very purpose. He imposed a moratorium on new Federal oil and gas leases on Federal lands, failed to meet the statutory deadlines for quarterly lease sales, and took countless other anti-energy measures that have contributed to increased gas prices and inflation reaching record levels. The only reason oil and gas permits on Federal lands are being approved at nearly the same rate during the Biden administration as during the Trump administration is because of the permitting reforms put in place by the Trump administration. In essence, they had a head start. This administration also likes to try and take credit for supporting oil and gas production, but the reality is this occurred in spite of them, not because of them. In fact, much of this production has occurred on private lands where producers aren't stifled by Federal policies and moratoriums. In 2020, the National Ocean Industries Association found that Joe Biden's proposal to ban new offshore oil and gas drilling in Federal waters would kill approximately 200,000 jobs, cost the Federal Government billions of dollars of revenue, and push production to foreign adversaries. Furthermore, and despite the exaggerations from the administration, domestic production reached its highest point ever in 2020 while President Donald J. Trump was in office with over 13 million barrels of oil produced a day. We all want clean air. We all want clean water. But we also want lower gas prices and good-paying jobs right here in America. We can have it all, as responsible energy production and conservation are not mutually exclusive goals. My amendment strikes the right balance. Again, it allows for responsible emergency use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves while also allowing for responsible American energy production on Federal lands. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson)."

              "Amendment No. 30 expresses the sense of Congress that the royalty rate for onshore Federal oil and gas leases be 12\\1/2\\ percent. This amendment establishes that it is the sense of Congress that the royalty rate of onshore Federal oil and gas leases be 12\\1/2\\ percent, the pre-Inflation Reduction Act level. The so-called Inflation Reduction Act was filled with horrific policy and has only made things worse. The Inflation Reduction Act is geared to severely harm American energy independence by, among other things, increasing royalty rates and fees while restricting access to energy resources. Our country needs to produce more energy, not less, but Democrats designed their extreme climate agenda to restrict oil and natural gas production. One measure of the so-called Inflation Reduction Act enabled the Biden administration to raise the oil and gas royalty rate for certain offshore leases from the current 12\\1/2\\ percent to 16.67. This measure will only result in less oil and gas production, harming consumers and our national security. The Biden administration doesn't even pretend otherwise. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said, It resets how and what we consider to be the highest and best use of American resources. This is about the use of the land, and the Biden administration clearly wants to block all of our lands from the use for oil and gas production. My amendment simply returns onshore royalty rates to what it was 2 years ago, before this radical Democrat intervention. This amendment would affirm the intent of the underlying bill, which would reset the royalty rate for onshore leases to 12\\1/2\\ percent. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "my amendment would prohibit any new leases under this plan that do not provide a fair return for taxpayers. For far too long, our oil and gas leasing program has offered a sweetheart deal for the industry at the expense of taxpayers. One fossil fuel company recently even went so far as to outline in a press release the many benefits of extraction on public land compared to private land. Their release highlighted that leases on public lands are cheaper, they last longer, and they are more expansive. While these statements may be music to the ears of those who care most about Big Oil special interests, they represent a raw deal for the American people. Increasing the royalty rate to a fair level will generate billions of dollars in revenue for taxpayers. The Government Accountability Office and Congressional Budget Office both agree and have suggested that this is good policy. That is why last Congress I introduced the Restoring Community Input and Public Protections in Oil and Gas Leasing Act, to protect taxpayers by eliminating noncompetitive oil and gas leasing and raising the onshore oil and gas royalty rate, rental fee, and minimum bid amount. I am proud that the Inflation Reduction Act includes significant provisions of that bill, including eliminating noncompetitive leasing for oil and gas sales, raising annual rental rates, and increasing the minimum bid for public lands. These provisions will go a long way in ensuring the American people see a more fair return on the use of our cherished public lands. But we have more work to do to provide a fair return. States like Texas and Oklahoma charge higher royalty rates on their State lands than are charged on Federal public lands, leading to lost revenue for Federal taxpayers. This amendment builds on those provisions and will help end giveaways of our public lands to fossil fuel companies and ensure that taxpayers receive a fair return on any private profit that oil and gas companies extract from our public lands. The American people deserve to see a fair financial return on the profits that fossil fuel companies make from their use of our cherished public lands, and this amendment will require that these companies provide that return instead of simply ripping the public off. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "my first amendment will strike title V of division B of this bill. Throughout this debate, I have heard my friends across the aisle argue that the bill before us today is a reasonable attempt to reform our permitting system. Unfortunately, this bill closely resembles a wish list for Big Oil and their lobbyists. This amendment would strike one of the most egregious portions of the bill that would undo many of the reforms we made last Congress to ensure that the American people see a better return on our public lands and waters. We should all be able to agree that the American people deserve a fair deal when it comes to the use of our cherished public lands. For far too long, our oil and gas leasing program has offered a sweetheart deal for the fossil fuel industry at the expense of taxpayers. One fossil fuel company even went so far as to outline in a press release the many benefits of extraction on public land compared to private land. Their release highlighted that leases on public lands are cheaper, last longer, and are more expansive. While these statements may be music to the ears of those who care most about Big Oil interests, they represent a raw and an unfair deal for the American people. Increasing the royalty rate to a fair level--that is all we are asking, a fair level--will generate billions of dollars in revenue for taxpayers. The Government Accountability Office and Congressional Budget Office both agree and have suggested that it is good policy. That is why, last Congress, I introduced the Restoring Community Input and Public Protections in Oil and Gas Leasing Act to protect taxpayers by eliminating noncompetitive oil and gas leasing and raising the onshore oil and gas royalty rate, rental fee, and minimum bid amount. I am proud that the Inflation Reduction Act includes significant provisions of that bill, including eliminating noncompetitive leasing for oil and gas sales, raising annual rental rates, and increasing the minimum bid for public lands. These commonsense reforms were simply long-overdue fixes to create more balanced fiscal terms and bring Federal lands in line with what States and private landowners already charge. Before the IRA, the fiscal terms for public lands leasing and drilling were, in some cases, over 100 years old. For decades, these outdated rates and fees allowed oil CEOs to lease public lands for pennies on the dollar and unfairly increase their profits at the expense of taxpayers. Even after the IRA, States like Texas and Oklahoma still charge higher royalty rates on their State lands than are charged on Federal public lands. According to Taxpayers for Common Sense, these updated fiscal terms included in the IRA will not raise prices at the pump or consumer energy prices, but they will raise billions of dollars in additional revenue that could go toward our funding education, healthcare, and infrastructure improvements that benefit everyone, not just oil and gas companies. Unfortunately, the bill before us today would also reinstate noncompetitive leasing, an indefensible practice. The Government Accountability Office also found that 99 percent of noncompetitive leases issued between 2003 and 2009 never produced oil and gas during their 10-year lease terms. The reason why these lands were not put into production is that they are leased in areas where there is virtually no likelihood of development. At its core, noncompetitive leasing is a wasteful practice that forces the Bureau of Land Management to expend limited public agency time and resources administering leases that hardly ever generate returns for taxpayers. It encourages oil and gas companies to buy up lands they will never use to pad their portfolios and appease shareholders, contributing to the 12.3 million acres of leased public lands that these companies are currently sitting on and not using. Instead of maintaining these commonsense reforms and protecting the interests of American taxpayers, title V of the bill before us today would undo all of these reforms and provide a gift to oil and gas interests. By rolling back these reforms, the majority is proposing policies that would only pad Big Oil's pocketbooks even further and increase our Federal deficit by $160 million over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, even as companies like ExxonMobil and Shell are announcing record profits. By striking this title, we can put these dollars back in the pockets of the American people and protect commonsense reforms that are finally ensuring that Federal taxpayers receive a fair return on any private profit that oil and gas companies extract from our public lands. I urge my colleagues to stand up for the American people and stand against our increasing national debt by supporting this amendment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "I rise to offer an amendment to the Strategic Production Reserve Act to prohibit the Secretary of Energy from approving new oil and gas leases on Federal lands that have high concentrations of orphaned oil and gas wells. Over the 160-year history of industrial oil and gas extraction in the United States, companies have dug millions of oil wells to fuel energy demands at home and around the world. When the pumps run dry and the wells are no longer profitable, companies are supposed to seal them up to stop toxic chemicals from escaping into the environment. Unfortunately, they often have not. Between the lax regulations of the oil boom and the patchwork of current State and Federal laws, oil companies have been able to shirk their responsibility to keep the communities around their wells safe. Today, the American landscape is dotted with abandoned, uncapped wells that leak toxins into the air we breathe and the water we drink. The U.S. Geological Survey has documented more than 117,000 orphaned wells, and the EPA estimates that as many as 3 million could exist across the country. Last year, as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Congress authorized $4.7 billion in investment to plug orphaned wells and protect the areas around them from further environmental harm. But even with this funding, the government is playing whack-a-mole-- with new orphaned wells emerging as we struggle to clean up the ones we already have. Right now, as we debate this bill, the largest owner of oil and gas wells in the country is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy that could leave more than 70,000 orphaned wells spewing poison in different parts of the country. As taxpayers cover the tab for the mess that oil companies created, we should not be signing leases that open the door to a new generation of orphaned wells. My State of Texas is the top oil and gas producing State in the Nation, and I am acutely aware of how important the energy industry is to our State and our national economy. This amendment does not ask oil companies to repay taxpayers for the billions we have already spent to clean up their toxic wells, and it doesn't prevent further drilling. Instead, it pauses new drilling leases on Federal lands with the highest concentration of orphaned wells--giving the government a chance to catch up with the cleanup efforts that are already underway. This is a commonsense amendment that would bring relief to the 14 million Americans who live within a mile of an orphaned well. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "the gentleman from Texas' amendment would undermine EPAs critical Underground Injection Control program and endanger the health of communities around the Nation, in my opinion. The Underground Injection Control program, or UIC, regulates injection wells to protect drinking water sources. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA implements the program, but can delegate primary enforcement authority, or primacy, to a State. To be granted primacy, States must demonstrate to EPA that they, among other things, have regulations in place that meet various minimum requirements. The point of this application and EPA approval process is to ensure there is a Federal floor to regulations so drinking water is protected across the country. This amendment seeks to expedite approvals of primacy applications by effectively rubber-stamping State UIC programs for class 6 wells, those used for carbon sequestration, if EPA hasn't acted on the State application within the review period. Just like other permit deadline provisions of the polluters over peoples act, this would be dangerous. While this amendment targets class 6 wells used for underground injection of carbon dioxide, the text, as written, would apply to State program applications or program revisions for all well types, including hazardous waste injection wells. UIC programs should be rigorous and protective. We should not gamble with people's drinking water. Once water is contaminated, we cannot easily reverse course. If Republicans care about the implementation of this program, they would support EPA as it works to ensure robust State programs are in place before granting primacy. In fact, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $25 million toward that goal. So if States want primacy, they should complete the application process and be held to the Federal standard so Americans know their water is safe. Circumventing this process will only put communities in jeopardy. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this amendment and encourage my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I really hope this amendment can be bipartisan. I see no reason why it wouldn't be. It simply provides predictability for States applying for primacy of class 6 carbon capture wells. It is very straight forward. When a State submits a primacy application to the EPA, the EPA has 270 days to either approve or deny the application. If the EPA is unable to do so within that generous time window, we give them another 30 days to explain why. If, for whatever reason, the EPA fails to make a determination after 300 days, then the State can move forward. Importantly, we preserve EPA's ability to deny the application or revoke the approval using emergency measures under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Why is this needed? Unfortunately, when States submit primacy applications for these wells, it can take years for the EPA to even bother to review the application. There is a lot more demand for carbon capture projects. They are ramping up around the country, especially in Houston. The need for expanded permitting capacity has greatly increased. The EPA should not be the roadblock to projects that are designed to reduce carbon emissions. Let me say that again: Reduce carbon emissions. The International Energy Agency said carbon capture is necessary to meet national, regional, and even corporate emissions reductions goals. Even EPA administrator Michael Regan called carbon capture a priority for the Biden administration. It is a bipartisan issue. States like Texas have already proven they can manage these wells and giving them primacy will be a game changer for speeding up carbon capture projects. Giving States regulatory certainty is critical to successful carbon capture projects moving forward in their States. That is all this amendment does. Mr. Speaker, there is no reason why this should not be bipartisan, and I encourage my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "When we were in the majority, Democrats, we passed H.R. 1. What was that about? It was not about elections. It was about our democracy. It was about protecting that democracy. After January 6, that became urgent. Now, some might want to deny that--that was just a walk in the park, people taking a stroll. We were here. We knew what was going on, and the American people knew what was going on. The issue of patriotism has been brought up. It is patriotic for us to oppose polluters over people. It is patriotic because we care and feel that the public health of the American people needs to be protected, that we have to deal with climate and the crisis that we are confronting. To question the patriotism of those instincts is wrong, and we will continue to represent the American people on their most urgent needs. The future and their destinies shouldn't be turned over to Big Oil and Big Gas and the mining industry, for them to determine that future. They have to have a role, and our statutes and the protections that are in our laws need to be part of that role. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).",
              "permitting reform, we all want it. There is a simple solution. Separate the question. But why not? We need to ask why not. Because this bill includes massive handouts to big corporations and incentivizes them to leak methane into the atmosphere. Let's just look at the bill's name: LECA. They are telling it like it is, folks, and we should be listening. There is a choice being made here by House Republicans, Mr. Speaker. They are not doing this to make our system more efficient or to lower costs for the American people, quite the opposite. This bill repeals $4.5 billion in home electrification, a program that the Department of Energy estimates could save Americans thousands of dollars annually. If we were focused on lowering costs for American families, this is what we would be focused on. I talk to west Michiganders every single day about what they want and what they need. We want to protect the Great Lakes. We want to lower our energy costs, and that means investing in conservation efforts and putting smart regulations in place that support the longevity of the Great Lakes economy. That means ensuring a future for the next generation of west Michiganders. The Big Oil giveaway act does none of that. It greatly expands companies' ability to exploit public land. Michigan-3 is home to a large portion of the Grand River watershed and miles of beautiful Lake Michigan shoreline. I support protecting our most beautiful protected areas, not stripping them for parts. What House Republicans are doing is this: Holding an antiquated permitting system hostage to extract benefits for Big Oil corporations. If they want to come to the table in good faith on serious bipartisan efforts to streamline the permitting process and lower energy costs for American families, I will be the first in line.",
              "I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 1. This bill puts the needs of the oil industry over the health and well-being of the American people. Instead of protecting the communities we are here to represent, the bill will cause real harm to people's health and further degrade our environment. While my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim the bill will help lower Americans' energy costs and make us energy independent, in fact, the bill does just the opposite. Here is why. By opening LNG exports and doubling down on fossil fuels, this legislation will further increase our reliance on the global oil and gas markets. It will further subject us to the volatility of the global marketplace. Frankly, it will do nothing to increase our security here at home because we simply can't drill our way toward lower energy costs. The only way to bring energy costs down here in America, and to make our Nation truly energy independent, is to expedite the transition to more renewable forms of energy. In addition, any claim that this legislation does not touch some part of our Nation's most important environmental laws is just untrue. The bill decimates the laws that were put in place to protect our air, water, and, most of all, our health. It repeals key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, provisions that actually bring down the costs for Americans and reduce emissions. So now, instead of working with us to find real bipartisan solutions to the crises we face, the majority severely limited amendments to this bill in violation of the promises they made at the beginning. I offered some commonsense amendments to the legislation that, unfortunately, were not made in order. One would have restricted the use of eminent domain for natural gas pipelines to ensure communities have a voice in our energy decisions. The other would have required a simple analysis to eliminate methane emissions from projects under NEPA review. However, we don't have the ability to have those conversations because the majority doesn't want to hear it. I want to say what I said in the committee markup: Mr. Speaker, once my colleagues on the other side of the aisle get this out of their system, I stand willing, ready, and able to work on a bipartisan solution that will both help increase our energy security in the United States and will make us independent from a volatile foreign oil market."

              "I thank the chairwoman for her leadership on this bill. The Lower Energy Costs Act is a product of countless hours of discussion between leadership, stakeholders, and our constituents, who are tired of higher costs for less reliable energy. The United States has an incredible energy potential. We have vast resources of oil, natural gas, and other critical minerals essential for energy dominance. Only a few years ago, we were a global leader in both oil and gas production. This was achieved through American innovation, domestic energy production, and investment from the private sector in developing our critical energy infrastructure. Unfortunately, the Biden administration vowed to wage war on American energy. Starting on his very first day in office with the help of the Democrats here in Congress, the Biden administration has pursued radical rush-to-green energy policies that made energy less secure, less reliable, and more expensive for our constituents. This has led to increased costs of energy and goods, hitting the most vulnerable the hardest. We should be about increasing the standard of living for Americans versus diminishing the standard of living that these anti-American energy policies actually do. Energy is the foundation of everything in American life. When the cost of energy goes up, everything else does, as well. H.R. 1 should help America and will help America produce more, deliver more to our communities, and give us the ability to export and help our allies around the world. The American people recognize this, and they are sick of choosing between paying their energy bills and putting food on the table, which is why they gave us the majority, to stop this radical energy agenda. I am proud that my bill, Protecting American Energy Production Act, was included in this package. This provision will protect energy security and affordability by prohibiting the President from imposing a ban on hydraulic fracturing. The discovery of natural gas through the shale revolution has made the United States a leader in energy production as well as emissions reduction and has allowed the United States of America, not our adversaries, to set the price of energy. We are approaching the breaking point in our energy infrastructure. The so-called rush-to-green agenda has prevented the buildout of natural gas and other essential energy infrastructure, which is now reaching capacity. Many States, like my own State of South Carolina, are now at risk of approaching an energy deficit in the next few years if we don't immediately change our current regulatory framework. Fortunately, H.R. 1 addresses these concerns by requiring States to raise legitimate water quality concerns for interstate pipelines and LNG export facilities through FERC's NEPA process instead of weaponizing section 401 of the Clean Water Act to block pipelines. This change is critical to prevent the political agenda of States abusing section 401 to veto projects of national significance while preserving the ability of States to raise legitimate water quality concerns. New England States could finally get gas from the Marcellus shale instead of importing natural gas from Russia, Iran, Venezuela, and a lot of our other adversaries around the globe. We have the resources here not only to meet our domestic demand but also to be a leading exporter globally. Representative DeGette mentioned earlier about capacity and U.S. production and how that would limit available gas for American domestic energy production. The Progressive Policy Institute, which is far from a conservative think tank, put out an article, ``The Climate Case for Expanding U.S. Natural Gas Exports,'' which talks about using that domestically. I would ask you to read it. This package also sets a framework to export our domestic resources so our allies will no longer have to rely on Vladimir Putin's energy oligarchy. The Democrats keep calling this the polluters over people act. That couldn't be further from the truth. The reality is that their energy policies put Russia, China, OPEC+, and radical Green New Deal interests over the interests of the American people. The greatest beneficiaries of their policies are the CCP and Vladimir Putin. Green New Deal policies leave us totally dependent on China for critical minerals that make all of our devices work. Even the green energy devices, wind and solar, need those critical minerals. We have them here. We harvest them cleaner, more environmentally friendly than anywhere in the world. Let's produce them here. That is what H.R. 1 allows us to do. H.R. 1 puts the American people first by unleashing American energy and securing our supply chains. It will increase American energy production and restore American energy leadership in the world. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act. As an engineer, I have learned that no issue is too difficult for American innovation and ingenuity to solve when we honestly identify the problem, develop a sound plan to solve it, and do the hard work to get the results we desire. The truth we all know is America has an energy crisis. Energy is foundational to everything we do, and for the sake of our future, we must solve this problem. Energy prices, in general, have gone up nearly 40 percent in a little over 2 years. High energy costs translate throughout the economy, causing inflated prices for every necessity of life, from the food we eat to the clothes we wear to the roof over our heads. President Biden has said he is working to lower these costs. But his actions are drowning out his words. He has waged war on American producers, shutting down oil and gas leasing, banning mining development in certain areas, and insisting on keeping our Federal regulations permanently stuck in the past. What are we getting in return? We are getting more dependence on the worst polluters in the world while we wreck our own economy sending our wealth and jobs overseas. Our current energy policies favor Putin, the Chinese Communist Party, and despots around the globe over the American people and freedom. Why would our friends across the aisle continue to put the worst polluters, human rights violators, and those who wish us harm above the American people? No more. H.R. 1 is designed to solve our energy crisis. House Republicans are ready to show the world that American energy--not Saudi Arabian, not Venezuelan, not Chinese, or Russian energy--American energy is our future. American mining, American innovation, American processing and refining, American manufacturing, and American infrastructure will lead us out of this energy crisis. H.R. 1 outlines this through a variety of measures. First, it rolls back the Biden administration's oil and gas leasing moratoriums, giving producers certainty to produce resources safely and responsibly right here at home. Next, given the importance of minerals to our national security, clean energy technology, and a host of everyday uses, H.R. 1 shores up domestic supply chains for commodities like copper, lithium, and cobalt, and allows us to make our energy infrastructure where it should be made--right here at home in the United States. Every ounce we produce here is an ounce less we and our allies are forced to purchase from Chinese-controlled mines with deplorable labor and environmental standards. And, of course, none of this is possible without modernizing the Federal regulations that delay the projects we desperately need. If you don't believe permitting reform is needed, maybe you will believe President Biden's senior adviser, John Podesta, who recently said: ``We can move faster by setting tighter deadlines for agencies to complete environmental reviews. We can move smarter by making it easier to approve projects with low environmental impact . . . But Congress needs to do its job . . . So it is time to get back to work and pass permitting reform legislation.'' We are called to be good stewards of our resources and leave them better than we found them. That is the definition of conservation. We cannot say our global resources are better off today under Democratic policies. China is building coal plants at a rapid pace, using slave labor to construct solar panels and develop critical minerals, while Russia is not only one of the worst environmental catastrophes on the planet, but they are also using their energy revenues to fund their war in Ukraine. We cannot continue to turn a blind eye to these injustices and say, ``not in my backyard.'' America drills, mines, builds, and innovates cleaner, safer, and more responsibly than anywhere else in the world. Before American innovators and workers can solve our energy problems, we need a plan. H.R. 1 is the plan to solve our energy crisis. For these and many more reasons, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Lower Energy Costs Act. H.R. 1 is the blueprint to ease the burden of this self-inflicted energy crisis on American families. H.R. 1, when executed, will make the United States more secure and competitive on the global stage. Ultimately, H.R. 1 will improve the health and longevity of our natural resources, create a better climate, and spur economic growth and jobs--these are results we should all get behind. Mr. Speaker, you don't have to be an engineer to solve this energy problem. I urge all of my colleagues to join with me and vote a resounding ``yes'' in support of H.R. 1. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on the Budget, Washington, DC, March 20, 2023. Hon. Bruce Westerman, Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Westerman: I am writing regarding H.R. 1335, the Transparency, Accountability, Permitting, and Production of American Resources Act, which was ordered reported by the Committee on Natural Resources on March 9, 2023. The bill contains provisions that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget. In order to expedite House consideration of H.R. 1335, the Committee on the Budget will forgo action on this bill. This is being done with the understanding that it does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in H.R. 1335 or similar legislation and that the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that the Committee may address any remaining issues that fall within its jurisdiction. The Committee on the Budget also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation and requests your support of any such request. I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 1335 and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in your committee report and in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 1335. Sincerely, Jodey C. Arrington, Chairman, Committee on the Budget.",
              "I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for the great job she is doing as chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee to bring forward important bills that will increase America's national security and energy security. There is absolutely no reason that we have to be reliant on foreign countries for our energy. We have actually got the energy here in America. In fact, for those people that are concerned about carbon emissions, for all those carbon footprint warriors that got on their private jets and flew to Davos last week to lecture the rest of the world about not using fossil fuels--they didn't take commercial flights. They had to take their private charters, not with solar panels on the wings of those airplanes, using jet fuel. They lecture the whole world about getting rid of fossil fuels in America, not in other countries. You saw President Biden himself get on Air Force One and fly to Saudi and beg Saudi princes to produce more energy as he is shutting down production in America, limiting leases, limiting pipelines, killing Keystone and other pipelines, limiting the ability to get permits to do basic exploration in America. He is green-lighting pipelines in Russia, green-lighting pipelines and drilling in other places, urging and begging drilling in other places. By the way, if you are concerned about the carbon footprint, no country in the world that produces energy does it better than America. We should want to be doing more in America. As production goes up and goes down based on good or bad policies, as we are seeing today with bad policies, the Nation back in the 1970s said that we are going to have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve--in essence, an American piggy bank to protect our country in case there is some major disruption in world markets, in energy production in America. Maybe there is a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico that limits our ability to produce energy for a brief period of time. That is why we have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is not there to go mask your bad policies. Yet, that is what we have seen from this President. As you can see, this President has raided more than 40 percent of America's strategic reserve; our piggy bank. He has just taken it away. In some cases, he actually sold that oil to China. We came together last week, Republicans and Democrats. The press actually said it was going to be a partisan exercise, so why even waste the time. What they found out is not only did a Republican say it is wrong to raid our piggy bank in America and sell it to China, a majority of Democrats actually agreed with us and sent that bill to the Senate. I urge the Senate to take up that bill that is important to America's national security. But then, today we go even further and say, Mr. Speaker, with this bill, H.R. 21, if you are going to raid our reserves, won't you at least put forward a plan to show how you will replace it. Don't worry. I know the White House gets nervous when you tell them that you have got to produce energy in America. They don't have a problem, again, with foreign countries producing energy. They just don't want it made in America. They use the tagline a lot. You hear it all the time, made in America; except when it comes to making energy, they don't want to make it in America. They make it harder to make it in America. They beg foreign countries to make our energy. This bill says--gives an exemption--except in the case of a severe energy supply interruption. So the President's still got the ability, if there is some actual emergency, to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve the way it was intended in the 1970s. All this bill says is if your bad policy is leading to higher gas prices--and people are getting angry about that, as they should--you can't go and raid it unless you show a plan, as the bill says, the development of a plan to increase oil and gas production under oil and gas leases of Federal lands here. So this would make a lot of sense, except if you are at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In fact, yesterday, the President actually issued a veto threat on this bill. Now, a veto threat should be a rare exercise that you reserve for policy that might hurt the country. Well, let's read why the President issued the veto threat. In his veto threat he said, the administration's use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has been essential to protecting our energy security and to lowering gas prices for Americans. I hope I am not the one that breaks this news to the White House, but Mr. Speaker, your policies have not lowered gas prices for Americans. Maybe the calculator is broken at the White House, but we did the math. Let's do some fact-checking. Since Joe Biden took the oath of office, gas prices have not lowered; they have increased 50 percent. Then the veto threat says, we don't want to do this because our policies have lowered gas prices. Maybe the President, when he realizes that gas prices have gone up 50 percent--they have not lowered for families--he might reverse the veto threat. So we will wait during this debate. Maybe we will get a reversal of this veto threat once he realizes that gas prices have actually gone up, not a little, but a lot, 50 percent increase for a low-income family who is struggling already under the weight of President Biden's spending that has led to inflation and higher prices everywhere you go, the grocery store, supply chain increases. This is crushing middle-class families. It is crushing lower-income families. So what we say is, let's just use our resources. The President actually goes on to say--and this might be the most perplexing part of the President's veto threat; probably explains the most why the President is so misguided on energy policy. He says, because H.R. 21 will jeopardize our energy security and increase gas prices for working families, the administration strongly opposes the bill. So, somehow, some of the energy experts at the White House, again, some of the same people that fly around on private planes to Davos telling you not to use fossil fuels, they think that by increasing American energy production that will somehow raise gas prices. Well, guess what? We have checked the record. These are the same experts whose policies have increased gas prices, not a little, 50 percent. So the White House has been wrong on this issue over and over again, to the point where we had such a strong bipartisan vote last week. Let's put up another strong bipartisan vote and maybe wake the people up at the White House as to what is happening in the real world. When families who are struggling go to fill up their gas tanks, they are not paying less, as the President suggests. Again, the President actually thinks, in his veto threat, that his policies have lowered gas prices. A 50 percent increase is not a lower gas price. It is actually a kick to the gut of those families who are struggling; and we have got to stop having Washington kick them in the gut. So if you look at the moniker right above the Speaker's rostrum, there is a plaque that says, let us develop the natural resources of our land. Why don't we actually do that? Why don't we actually do what has proven to work over and over again? If we open up American energy, it is the cleanest in the world. Don't beg foreign dictators to do it. They don't do it as clean as us, by the way; and it also lowers prices. It also creates good American jobs. Let's actually make it in America again and, if you are going to raid the piggy bank, at minimum, show the country your plan for how you plan to replace it. That is the least this President should do. Let's pass this bill with a strong vote over to the Senate and then get this on the President's desk, and maybe he will reconsider and recognize just what his policies have done to hurt families over these last 2 years. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 21."

              "I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for his great leadership in opposing this reckless legislation that is on the floor today. I thank Mr. Grijalva for his leadership, as well as our ranking member on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Mr. Larsen, for their setting the record straight in the different categories of this legislation. The gentleman from New Jersey just set the record straight again. I thank the gentleman so much for giving a history lesson to some in this room who may not remember the course of events that has taken us to this place. Today, Mr. Speaker, I rise to join in sounding the alarm, a five- alarm climate emergency, which is the existential threat of our time. Many of our colleagues, including our distinguished ranking members, have gone into detail about opposition to this bill. I want to focus on the climate aspect. It was with pride during my term as Speaker that House Democrats made climate our flagship issue. When we enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, our Nation took a landmark step to rescue our planet. Yet, our progress stands in sharp contrast to the reckless Republican bill before us, which, on every score, puts polluters first. We know that climate is a health issue. The gentleman referenced that in his comments. While Democrats are slashing pollution to preserve clean air and water, this bill guts bedrock health protections to fast- track polluter projects. Climate is an economic issue. While Democrats are creating jobs and lowering energy costs, this bill gives $2.4 billion in handouts to the biggest polluters. Climate is a national security issue. While Democrats are declaring America's energy independence, this bill seeks to keep us at the mercy of oil-rich dictators. Finally, climate is a moral issue. While Democrats are honoring our obligation to pass on a healthy planet to our children and grandchildren, this bill is nothing short of a dereliction of duty. It is God's creation. We are religious people here in this body, right? It is God's creation. Don't we have a responsibility to be good stewards of God's creation? The climate emergency is putting lives at risk right now, with extreme weather pillaging communities that you represent and hitting families at the kitchen table. With this legislation, Republicans have chosen to ignore the needs of America's working families. Instead, Republicans are putting polluters over people. For the planet, and for the children, I urge a ``no'' vote.",
              "Mr. Speaker, today I rise in urgent opposition to the Republicans' H.R. 1. Last week, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its final report. Their message couldn't be clearer. We have a lot to do and very little time to do it before the ticking climate bomb we are living in goes off. I want to emphasize that their message wasn't one of complete despair. There is hope. The hope hinges on two major conditions. One, we must stop burning fossil fuels, the number one cause of climate change. And two, we must transform our energy system to a cleaner and more sustainable one now. H.R. 1, the bill before us today, which has earned the fitting title of polluters over people act, will actively and aggressively take us backwards on both those accounts. Looking more like a nearly 200-page love letter to polluting industries than a serious legislative effort, the polluters over people act is a laundry list of gifts and giveaways to polluting industries. Let's look at what it does for Big Oil. For example, last year companies shattered profit records across the board by price gouging working Americans at the pump while also hoarding thousands of unused leases on our public lands and waters. Rather than hold Big Oil accountable for this abuse, the polluters over people act lowers royalty rates, repeals interest fees, reinstates noncompetitive leasing, and forces Federal agencies to hold rock-bottom lease sales all but assuring that last year's profit records will soon be broken again. Never to be outdone, the mining industry gets its fair share of gifts in H.R. 1, as well. Mining companies, many of which are foreign-owned, already enjoy a free-for-all on our public lands. They make a mockery of Tribal consultation, destroy sacred and special places, ruin the landscape, and leave behind a toxic mess that pollutes our water and hurts our health--all without paying a cent to the American people--not one red cent is paid in royalties. Now included in this package is that they can use the public land for anything they want, including dumping of toxic mineral waste. There is more, but suffice it to say, with all these handouts, it comes as no surprise that the Congressional Budget Office just reported last week that H.R. 1 will actually increase the Federal deficit. Staying true to its name, the polluters over people act also fast- tracks dirty energy projects by gutting our bedrock environmental and public health laws; namely, the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. This is not in a new so-called permitting reform solution they have come up with to address our energy needs. This is the same ideological attack I have seen Republicans in the Natural Resources Committee launch on NEPA year after year after year. For anyone who is being lured into thinking there are opportunities for negotiations on this bill--do not be naive. This performative permitting reform is not a bipartisan solution, not even a starting point for one. This is just another decades-old request from polluters to make their operations cheaper and easier, while making Americans' lives harder and more costly. It is not a serious solution to any of our energy goals. Even former President George W. Bush's head of permitting efforts has said that this bill will be ``of no statistically significant consequence.'' In fact, the polluters over people act has none of the real permitting solutions that can speed up the build-out of the clean energy infrastructure that we all need. One of those solutions would be increasing funding for Federal permitting offices, which is exactly what Democrats did when they secured more than $1 billion in last year's historic Inflation Reduction Act. Even Republicans' own witness at a hearing called that money ``wonderful.'' No more funding is in H.R. 1. Another solution for speeding up clean energy development is reforming the planning and cost allocation process for electrical transmission lines that can carry renewable energy from different sources across the country. But, no, you are not going to see that in H.R. 1 either. Of course, any real permitting reform solutions would make sure to protect and empower the communities that have been disproportionately hurt by dirty energy and other polluters for decades--and that are now being hit the hardest by climate change as well. As you can probably guess, H.R. 1 doesn't just fail to protect these communities, it silences them further, laying them bare to even more devastation, harm, and exploitation. The polluters over people act isn't just an embarrassment of riches for polluting industries, it is an embarrassment to our communities, to our climate goals, and to this legislative body. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I rise in strong opposition to House Republicans' polluters over people act, H.R. 1. This dangerous bill appears to be doubling down on dirty fossil fuels to pad the profits of polluters and Big Oil. Our Republican friends seem to be oblivious to the fact that, as we speak, there are communities in this country devastated by extreme weather events, from deadly tornadoes to life-threatening atmospheric rivers to unprecedented snowfall. Instead of legislating with an eye toward the future, our colleagues across the aisle are bringing up a bill that pretends there is no climate crisis. Scientists agree that action on climate is literally life or death. The recent IPCC report that just came out reminds us that we are out of time. It is now or never if we want to spare our kids from a future that includes more frequent and even worse extreme weather events and more climate-driven food insecurity. The world's best climate scientists call this a climate time bomb. Our Republican colleagues call it a hoax, and they produce bills like this. My colleagues seem to want to talk about speeding up permitting. Great, let's talk about permitting. Democrats just secured $1 billion for permitting streamlining in the Inflation Reduction Act for that very purpose. Let me remind you, not a single Republican voted for that bill, which was actually a solution to accelerating clean energy. What are they trying to do instead? They are trying to claw back the funding that we approved. They are trying to slow down permitting and do the exact opposite of what they claim that they want to see with their so-called permitting reform package. If they want to protect this planet for future generations, then anyone who cares about that really needs to read the fine print of this bill because it would force agencies to hold oil and gas lease sales on public lands even if they are not needed. If these sales don't get enough bids, they are replaced with more sales, at lower prices. So we are not just giving away our public lands, we are doing it at laughably low prices, locking in these lands for oil and gas development for decades to come. This is not just extreme. It is obscene. The Inflation Reduction Act included multiple oil and gas leasing reforms, modest reforms, to ensure that the public finally gets a fair share for onshore and offshore fossil fuel development. If we are going to begin to address the impacts of the climate crisis, then ending massive fossil fuel subsidies is a pretty good place to start. Under this legislation, not only are we going in the opposite direction, we are removing even these modest provisions to allow taxpayers to finally get their fair share from the incredible profits that these polluting industries would receive. This legislation lowers royalty rates, repeals interest fees, reinstates noncompetitive leasing, and it does all of this while fossil fuel companies are rolling in record profits of $451 billion for the oil and gas industry last year. H.R. 1 is the biggest rollback of the Clean Water Act that we have seen in 50 years. It will remove important clean water protections for States and Tribal Governments specifically. Under current law, section 401 of the Clean Water Act gives States and Tribes authority to review water quality as well as requirements of State law on any project or activity that requires a Clean Water Act permit. This bill would slash that authority and shorten the time frame for which they can review such projects. Make no mistake, this will make it harder to protect the waterways and the communities that depend on clean water in this country. Whether you are in East Palestine or Philadelphia or anywhere else in this country, we should know better than to take something as critical as clean water for granted. I had an amendment that would retain these section 401 protections for Tribal Governments. This was a simple test because often some of my Republican colleagues say that they believe in Tribal sovereignty and they want to empower Tribal voices. So we came up with an amendment to let them do that, to just at least take away this terrible provision when it came to Tribal Governments. They declined to move that amendment forward. It was blocked. Why do our Republican colleagues want to block Tribal voices? One of the last details that we should note, if you listen to the debt ceiling debate, this cyclical, situational concern for fiscal conservatism which is coming around again, my colleagues on the other side shout from the rooftops now about the deficit. Well, guess what? This legislation is not just bad for people, not just bad for the planet, it is fiscally irresponsible. The CBO projects that it will add to the deficit. Just a reminder, the Inflation Reduction Act, which all of my friends voted against, paid for itself and reduced the deficit. Look, we do need to be talking about permit streamlining for clean energy infrastructure. This is very important. We need more efficient procedures to bring more renewable energy online, to modernize and upgrade electricity transmission facilities, but this bill doesn't even begin to touch any of that. That is our greatest need, and it is nowhere in this bill. If my Republican friends want to be taken seriously regarding permitting reform and not just giveaways to polluters, they need to offer real solutions. This package is not it. For the sake of the planet and future generations, I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. There are real, workable solutions to addressing our energy needs, extreme weather, food insecurity, and all of the downstream consequences of climate change, but this bill doesn't do it."

              "once again, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment, which would unnecessarily waive fundamental environmental laws for wildfire mitigation activity adjacent to roads. Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill we are considering today is a polluter wish list of environmental shortcuts designed to open our public lands to more and more extraction while cutting the public out of the decisionmaking process. The bottom line is, I simply do not think that Congress should be in the business of waiving requirements outlined in the Endangered Species Act or the National Environmental Protection Act. These laws provide critical protections that guide the management of our public lands and waters--critical protections that do not hinder efforts to mitigate wildfire risk or manage our forests. In fact, many of the activities contemplated by the amendment are covered under existing categorical exclusions, which allow land management agencies to carry out routine projects in a fast, efficient, and flexible manner. I will not deny that carrying out wildfire mitigation projects across our national forest and public land is a critical priority. However, we do not have to cast aside environmental standards to get it done. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I thank our chairman for his diligent work on H.R. 1 and the amendments that are going with it. I appreciate it. Mr. Speaker, I rise today not only to support H.R. 1, that will make long overdue changes to our permitting system and allow time-sensitive projects to be considered and approved in a reasonable timeframe, but I am also in support of two amendments that I am very pleased to see included. The first amendment is No. 23, otherwise known as the Combustion Avoidance along Rural Roads Act, or the CARR Act. The CARR Act is named after the 2018 devastating wildfire that occurred in Redding, California, that started from a flat trailer tire igniting roadside vegetation. This fire coined the term ``firenado'' as it occurred there with the deadly winds that whipped that fire into what became a 230,000-acre blaze that also took eight lives. This bill would waive time-consuming requirements under NEPA and the ESA for wildfire mitigation activities conducted within 300 feet of a roadway. These wildfire mitigation activities would include thinning, hazardous fuels reduction, prescribed burning, and vegetation management, and be overseen by the Department of the Interior or USDA, and be conducted on Federal land as administered by the National Park system, the Bureau of Land Management, or the Forest Service. Roadways, of course, can be a higher risk area for combustion. It only makes sense to do the type of thinning and management along roadways to vastly reduce that risk. Had this been in practice already, the Carr fire likely would not have happened. I hope we can have this kind of common sense be applied toward our roadsides under the CARR Act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "amendment No. 24, also known also the CLEAR Zones Act, is an enhancement of the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act. This amendment would extend the hazard zone around power lines to allow utility companies to clear trees that pose a danger to transmission infrastructure. It also gives automatic approval of vegetation management plans after 60 days, which keeps these plans moving forward while still giving adequate time for reasonable review instead of needless delays in these critical fire risk zones. During debate, I have heard some of my colleagues refer to this amendment and other proposals in H.R. 1 as a giveaway, in this case, to utility companies, or a trashing of the environment. That is offensively untrue. Indeed, the environment suffers much more by the massive amount of fire we are talking about. Both of my amendments are a direct response to wildfires that have already occurred in my district. Had they been in place, largely, the Camp fire that destroyed the town of Paradise, 153,000 acres and took 85 lives, would not have happened, as a fire caught from foliage that was underneath a power line. Also, the million-acre Dixie fire that occurred in my district from what looked like a healthy tree falling into a power line, destroyed two towns additionally, Greenville and Canyondam. I was there at Canyondam 5 minutes before it was lost completely. Unlike most environmental regulations, this policy is not just about potential future effects, it is also about the fires that have already happened. They have already destroyed homes, already taken lives. This is a message to those folks that your suffering was not needless. It is about stopping these wildfires from happening again by having wise management around our power lines so that the odds of fire occurring from these power lines existing in our rural areas is reduced greatly. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

              "I rise in strong support of this amendment, which creates a national strategy for America to reshore our mineral supply chains. Mr. Speaker, I want to just reiterate what the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee just said. Yesterday, the Secretary of the Interior of this Nation, who is in charge of millions of acres of Federal land, when asked on a mineral withdrawal in the biggest cooper- nickel find in the world, in northeastern Minnesota, called the Duluth Complex--which has 95 percent of this Nation's nickel reserve, almost 90 percent of the cobalt reserve, 75 percent of the platinum root metals, and a third of our copper--when the Secretary of the Interior yesterday was asked if there is critical minerals in that find, this is her answer: I don't know what kind of minerals were there. I don't think there were critical minerals. The Secretary of the Interior has no idea that cobalt and nickel are part of the critical minerals, of the 37 critical minerals identified by the Department of Energy. This is her response. We need a national strategy to reshore these minerals. I want to reiterate: This is offensive to my constituents who are ready and able to mine these critical minerals to secure our supply chain for this Nation. We have to secure our supply chain. We have to hold the dependency of this great Nation in the palm of our own hand, doing it with the best environmental standards and the best labor standards. We can't allow China to dominate in our critical minerals with zero environmental standards and zero labor standards. The Communist country of China owns 15 of the 19 industrial mines in the Congo that use child slave labor, and this administration just entered into a memorandum of understanding to allow child slaves to mine the minerals that we need. We can't do this anymore as the United States of America. We should never allow or purchase minerals mined by child slave labor. Again, this is the Secretary of the Interior of the United States of America. She has no idea what is happening with the withdrawal.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 1042, the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act, which I introduced with Mr. Latta. American leadership in nuclear energy and nuclear technology is critical to our economic and national security. One of the most urgent security threats America faces right now is our dangerous reliance on Russia's supply of nuclear fuels for our nuclear fleet. This threat has intensified as a result of the war in Ukraine. American nuclear fuel infrastructure has been stunted by policies that Russia has exploited by flooding the U.S. market with this cheaper fuel. Today that accounts for more than 20 percent of our nuclear fuels for American reactors. Last year alone, our industry paid over $800 million to Russia's state-owned nuclear energy corporation, Rosatom and its fuel subsidiaries. That number could be even higher this year, and these resources are no doubt going towards funding Putin's war efforts in Ukraine. Further, we have seen how Putin has weaponized Europe's reliance on Russian natural gas. There is no reason to believe that Russia wouldn't do the same with our nuclear fuel supply if Putin saw an opportunity. Rosatom has also supported China's nuclear energy ambitions. The risks of continuing this dependence on Russia for our nuclear fuel are simply too great. It is weakening America's nuclear fuel infrastructure, which has significantly declined because of the reliance on these cheap fuels. That is why I am leading H.R. 1042. Our bill bans fuel imports from Russia and sends a strong signal to the market that will help ensure America's nuclear leadership and fuel infrastructure. Our legislation also provides waivers to cover any supply gaps leading up to 2028, at which point no more Russian fuel will be allowed to be imported into the U.S. This bill both protects any short-term needs of the industry and provides the long-term certainty necessary to build out American capacity, as well as European capacity that serves our markets. H.R. 1042 has bipartisan support from the Committee on Energy and Commerce. It also has support from the nuclear industry, the nuclear fuels industry, and policy advocates. Additionally, the Biden administration has also said that a ban on Russian fuels is necessary to advance our domestic fuel build-out, including the fuels for advanced reactors. Across Europe, utility providers are starting to transition away from Russian fuels, announce new capacity, and invest in plant projects. We are seeing important fuel processes returning online in the United States. For example, the uranium conversion facility in Metropolis, Illinois, has restarted operations for the first time in years. That facility alone could meet the domestic uranium conversion needs within 2 years, but only if they have assurances that cheap Russian fuel won't undercut their business. The reality is, no facility owner is going to be able to invest to expand production capacity without the certainty of long-term contracts for their products. Those long-term contracts from fuel customers, the utility companies, will not be written if there remains uncertainty about Russian fuel continuing to flow into the United States, and the risk that Russia will once again be able to flood the market with cheaper products. H.R. 1042 provides those assurances to industry. American leadership in nuclear energy and nuclear technology is critical to our economic, energy, and national security, and a strong domestic nuclear fuel system, from mining to enrichment, is vital to our leadership. In the U.S. alone, nuclear energy provides nearly 20 percent of our electricity generation, all of which is emissions free. Nuclear plants operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, making them one of the most reliable, zero-carbon, baseload energy resources. H.R. 1042 will protect the short-term needs of the nuclear industry and provide the long-term certainty necessary to encourage investment and secure a durable domestic supply of fuel. I urge my colleagues to support the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act to restore our industry and take down Russia's nuclear fuel empire. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1042, the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act. Our imports of Russian nuclear fuel date back to the megatons for megawatts disarmament program at the end of the Cold War. That program has been over for a decade now, and we have developed a dependence on Russian uranium. Our Nation's nuclear reactors currently depend on Russia for nearly 15 percent of their enriched uranium. This is troubling because over the last 2 years we have seen how Russia tries to wield its energy resources as a weapon. It is simply unsustainable. I support ending our dangerous reliance on Russia for enriched uranium, but if we are serious about energy security, we cannot simply switch one foreign dependence for another. That is why we must invest in our own uranium fuel cycle here at home. Right now, we have limited fuel facilities to provide the nuclear fuel our existing fleet needs, much less the advanced fuels that future reactors will need. Any move we make to end our reliance on Russian uranium must be partnered with a build-out of our domestic uranium supply chain. Otherwise, any action would just increase cost to consumers and impact reliability. That is why in committee, Democrats attempted to partner this bill with authorizations to the Department of Energy to invest in U.S. domestic enrichment and conversion capacity. Unfortunately, those efforts were initially rejected by our Republican majority, therefore, I opposed this bill at that time. Fortunately, the committee has now advanced legislation that authorizes those investments in our domestic fuel cycle, and that language will be included in the final defense authorization bill. With that legislation set to become law, I am now much more comfortable moving this bill. After passage of the defense authorization bill, we must ensure these important programs are funded at the levels authorized so we can finally end our dangerous reliance on Russian uranium. The combination of banning imports of Russian uranium and investing in domestic capacity will provide private industry with both the certainty and the incentives it needs to invest in the nuclear fuel supply chain. This will help us become a world leader again, not just in fuel production for our current reactors, but in fuel production for the next generation of reactors, as well. I urge support for this bill, Mr. Speaker. I ask that we support this bill on a bipartisan basis. It is a good bill at this point, and we want to get it to the Senate as quickly as possible. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

              "I rise today in opposition to this legislation. First, I thank the ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee for yielding. Climate change is an existential threat to the United States and the world. Without action to reduce emissions, the damage to our Nation, economy, and future generations will be immeasurable. Americans understand the severity of this moment. That is why polling shows that most Americans want to prioritize the development of alternative energy sources over expanding the production of fossil fuels. The bill before us today will do the exact opposite. H.R. 1, the polluters over people act, is a brazen giveaway to the oil, gas, and mining industries. As Big Oil reaps record profits thanks to billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies, this bill will rubberstamp the construction of new natural gas pipelines and shut government agencies out of the review process. H.R. 1 will also mandate the auctioning of our public lands for oil and gas leases, make it easier to export liquefied natural gas to foreign adversaries, and allow oil companies to price gouge working families. This bill effectively gives energy companies a license to pollute. Simply put, it is a disaster for our environment and our fight against climate change. Americans do not want energy policy to come at the expense of public health. Many of my constituents have suffered for years from air pollution emitted from a local plant that runs on burning natural gas and fuel oil. This pollution has resulted in generations of families developing asthma in what is colloquially known as asthma alley. H.R. 1 will encourage this dangerous pollution in communities across the country. That is why I have submitted two amendments. One will protect these at-risk localities by removing restrictions preventing individuals from suing in response to a violation of NEPA if they bring a claim related to protecting public health. My second amendment would require publicly traded companies to disclose their goals and actions related to greenhouse gas emissions and meeting the goals of the Paris climate accord. These amendments were rejected by the Rules Committee, as were over 90 percent of the amendments proposed by my Democratic colleagues. So much for the open amendment process Republicans promised when they took over the majority. H.R. 1 is a reckless bill that empowers polluters to boost profits for Republicans' industry friends. Last year, Democrats acted to lower energy costs for working families and weaken our dependence on fossil fuels by passing the Inflation Reduction Act. The IRA was the largest-ever investment in fighting climate change while creating thousands of good-paying jobs, attracting billions of dollars in investment, and lowering the average American family's energy costs by about $1,800 a year. H.R. 1 seeks to reverse the progress we have made since passing the IRA. Mr. Speaker, this bill will take us backward both economically and environmentally, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.",
              "Just in rebuttal, my friend and Chairman Bruce Westerman put it best. He said when the Democrats talk about polluters over people, what they are actually referring to is not this bill. It is actually a reference to where we are now, thanks to Democratic reckless and radical policies. Right now, China is actually the largest emitter of CO2. Russian gas is much dirtier than gas from other places around the world, especially the United States where we have cheap, reliable, and clean natural gas. But instead of taking advantage of our God-given resources, Democrats and their reckless, radical policies make us more dependent on these forms of energy that are much dirtier. My good friend from Massachusetts said this bill will drag us back decades. Well, I do want this bill to take us back, not decades, but just to a few years ago when we had a Republican in the White House. Let us not forget that the United States, again, we currently lead the world in CO2 emission reduction, but between 2018 and 2019, the total reported greenhouse gas emissions from large facilities fell nearly 5 percent. Yeah, let's go back. Let's go back to that time. I find the talk about costs somewhat interesting because only in Washington, D.C., only in a place that lacks logic and accountability like Washington, D.C., can future revenue be considered a cost. Think about that. It is considered a cost. The math does not make sense. It is also quite fascinating that my friends across the aisle are now talking about deficits, which in the last 4 years they voted for over $4 trillion of increases to spending. Before I yield to my good friend from Texas, Dr. Burgess, I will point out a real-life example of what happens when we follow far-left, Democratic environmental policies. Often I wish that we had a real-life example that we could talk about in terms of policy, and here we do. It is called Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka, trying to search for a great ESG score to--I don't know, appease globalists, appease the ruling elite, appease woke Wall Street investors--they went for this ESG score and right now they are almost a failed state. Sri Lanka's green new deal, to be clear, was a human disaster. It is an ill-advised national experiment. Let me explain it. They went to organic farming. Organic farming yielded nothing but starvation, poverty, and chaos. President Rajapaksa, with no warning, with no attempt to teach farmers how to cope with change, announced a ban on all synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Again, he was after that ESG score. Ninety percent of Sri Lankan farmers relied on synthetic fertilizers. After the ban, 85 percent of farmers experienced crop loss. The damage done by this organic order was so extensive that the former President had to reverse himself less than 7 months later. Now, let's just bring this to political reality, the goals of the United States, where only 20 percent of electricity is powered by renewable energy, 20 percent renewable, and less than 10 percent of American families own an electric vehicle. By the way, those that own electric vehicles are overwhelmingly people who make over six figures a year. It is not your average Americans who are driving around in Teslas. Yet, the left seeks to unilaterally ban all hydrocarbons and instill these pipe dreams that the U.S. will generate all of its energy through wind and solar. All you have to do is look at California to see what comes next. Last August, Governor Newsom announced that they will ban the sale of gasoline cars by 2035. Just 1 week later, after that announcement, the electric grid was overwhelmed in California, and the State had to ask EV owners to limit when they plugged in their vehicles to charge. So if you ask yourself: Where does the policy of the left lead us? Look no further than to the idiocy of the policy in California and look no further than to the almost failed state of Sri Lanka. That is where these reckless, radical policies will lead the U.S. economy. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), the good doctor, my good friend, and fellow Rules Committee member.",
              "I thank the chairman, Bruce Westerman, for his work. Mr. Speaker, the chairman mentioned something about our last speaker from Pennsylvania. I am a little concerned. Maybe he didn't have time to read the whole bill because the bill he described is not the bill that is before us. He said somehow this would harm the environment. He was concerned about climate. If this bill passes, global emissions will be reduced. The chairman pointed out that the gentleman before, from the other side of the aisle, from Pennsylvania was criticizing this bill and he talked about the natural gas. I am not sure if the gentleman on the other side of the aisle has done any research or if he knows that American natural gas is 41 percent cleaner than Russian natural gas. It is an interesting little fact. If we had replaced for 1 year just Russian natural gas to Europe, we would have reduced CO2 emissions by more than 200 million tons. So, Mr. Speaker, it really begs the question: Who is the polluter? Those who defend Russia and vote against this bill. It is interesting the people opposing this bill, those I am hearing on the other side of the aisle--China, Russia, and OPEC. It is interesting the friends you keep. Now, let's talk a little bit about this. If you go across this country, Mr. Speaker, it costs too much to heat your home and fill up your car. It cost less an administration ago. Today, more than one-third of all Americans say they have skipped buying food or medicine to pay an energy bill in the last 12 months. We are going to have opportunity this week to make sure that they don't have to do that again if you vote ``yes.'' This is neither affordable nor sustainable. In response, President Biden has paid lip service to the need of more energy production, but this is a public relations stunt. Almost every one of his policies involves penalizing America and empowering China. Now, here are the facts: For years, President Biden and Democrats have attacked energy producers, blocked new leases on Federal land, and ground the permitting process to a halt. Their so-called Inflation Reduction Act included a natural gas tax, a $27 billion climate slush fund. The gentleman on the other side of the aisle from Pennsylvania, he supported taxing the natural gas that is produced in his State and creating a slush fund. Meanwhile, in my home State of California, burdensome environmental laws have led to recurring blackouts and more red tape that raises costs for everything. Rather than increasing production and providing good-paying jobs, California imported more than half of its oil from Ecuador in recent years. The interesting fact here is, when the Democrats took control of California under Governor Gavin Newsom, he reduced the amount of oil produced in California by 20 percent. That was 80,000 barrels a day. That doesn't mean California used 80,000 less barrels; it meant California started paying Putin for 50,000 barrels. They get the majority of their oil from Ecuador, from the Amazon. Instead of producing it in an environmentally sound way in California, we are harming the environment. That is exactly what this bill is able to do--lower global emissions, lower the price of energy, and make the world more secure and safe, because then Putin and Russia is not controlling Europe. Democrats have sent a clear message about their priorities. They are the party of $5 gas, subsidizing Communist China and the never-ending dependence on foreign dictators for minerals we have in America. It was only a few short years ago where America produced more of the critical minerals than China, but as the Democrats would shut down leases, make it harder to open new mines, they moved it to other parts of the world, and not in an environmentally sound way, but by empowering China, making them stronger, and making the price in America higher. Luckily, Congress has the opportunity to change the behavior of Washington by passing the Lower Energy Costs Act. Every Member of this chamber should support it. I understand why Russia and China oppose lower energy costs for America and making America stronger, but I don't understand why Members in this Congress would stand with China and Russia against America. The Lower Energy Costs Act does two important things: One, it restores American energy leadership by repealing unnecessary taxes and overregulation on American energy producers so we can lead the world in providing clean, affordable energy. Two, it makes it easier to build things in America. For example, this bill includes a 2-year time limit on environmental impact statements. It also streamlines the process for lawsuits so that activists can't use the courts to delay projects for years. Ninety years ago, American workers built the Empire State Building in 400 days. That is 13 months. These days, however, even repairing existing structures, just like Lake Isabella Dam in my district, has taken 18 years, and that was only because we were lucky in pushing for it. That is exactly how the Big Government under the Biden administration wants the system to work. Every time we need a pipeline, a road, or a dam, it gets held up on an average of 5 to 7 years and adds millions of dollars in costs for the project to comply with Washington's permitting process. It is too long. It is unaffordable. It is not based on science. It is holding us back. It is time we speed up the time it takes for us to build all kinds of things in America. We could streamline permitting, stop abusive lawsuits, protect the environment, and, importantly, lower the price of energy. This is why the Lower Energy Costs Act is H.R. 1. It signals how important the bill truly is. Mr. Speaker, when the Democrats were in the majority, do you know what their H.R. 1 bill was? Election. Why? They wanted to change the election law to try to guarantee their right to be reelected. You see, they looked after themselves. When Republicans took the majority, our H.R. 1 is about lowering energy costs for all Americans. We think it is important to serve others, not yourself. I get permitting reform isn't for everyone. If you like paying more at the pump, you don't want to make it faster for American workers to build more pipelines. If you are China, you would rather America sit back and let others lead. If you are a bureaucrat, maybe you really do enjoy reading the 600-page environmental impact studies. The rest of America wants lower prices, more cash in their hands, more good-paying jobs in America, and rules that are good for the environment. That is exactly what the Lower Energy Costs Act does. Mr. Speaker, America has the potential to become a true energy superpower. God has blessed us with abundant energy, and we shouldn't have to depend on other countries for our future. In fact, we should make the world dependent on us for energy. The world would be cleaner and safer, and America would be better off. If you want to have a responsible energy policy where America produces more energy, pays less for a gallon of gas, and never again bows to foreign dictators, vote ``yes'' on the Lower Energy Costs Act. Three things will happen when this bill becomes law. Your energy costs will be reduced. You will have more cash to take care of your family, to pay for your medicine, to take your family on vacation. It will reduce global emissions, so environmentally, the world will be a better place. It will make the world a safer place, so no longer does America pay Putin for dirtier oil or gas, so no longer does China control other nations because they control the critical minerals that America will not produce. No longer will we watch, as we watched in the 1930s, countries bound together to create an axis of power. We have now watched China enter the Middle East to bring Saudi Arabia and Iran together. That used to be the role of the American President at Camp David. It is no longer. We do not want to watch our President travel to the Middle East to beg to produce something more when America can produce it here in an environmentally sound way. Mr. Speaker, I know why Russia and China fight this bill so hard. I do not understand why those on the other side of the aisle join with Russia and China. I ask them to join with Americans and make America safe and environmentally sound and the world a more secure place."

              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 342, the Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2023 introduced by my friend, Representative Obernolte. H.R. 342 is a good-government bill that does exactly what it says it will: it improves accountability. When making awards, the Department of Energy is subject to cost-share requirements for most research, development, demonstration, and commercial application activities. DOE can modify or eliminate those requirements when necessary, an authority which has been critical to supporting and developing new technologies. This bill is very simple. It requires DOE to submit a quarterly report to Congress describing the instances where they have modified or waived those cost-share requirements. The bill also makes those reports publicly available. H.R. 342 doesn't prevent DOE from waiving cost-share requirements. It just ensures that those decisions are made public. This transparency and accountability is important because it allows us to ensure we are making the best possible use of taxpayer resources. It is a smart, bipartisan policy. I thank Representative Obernolte and Representative Foster for working on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I rise in support of H.R. 342--``The Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2023.'' H.R. 342 requires the Department of Energy to report quarterly to Congress on the use of the department's authority to reduce or eliminate cost-sharing requirements for various research, development, and demonstration projects. Specifically, this bill aims to establish the necessary requirements to effectively set the standards for quarterly reporting to Congress in order to ensure proper management of capital allotment between energy departments. Mr. Speaker, The Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 2005 (Public Law 109- 58), the underlying statute of H.R. 342 which provides the background history for H.R. 342, calls for the development of grant programs, demonstration and testing initiatives, and tax incentives that promote alternative fuels and advanced vehicles production and use. H.R. 342--``The Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2023'' will provide advancements towards energy innovations that will benefit both the state of energy independence of the United States as well as critical energy advancements for the future. The Secretary of Energy has the authority to reduce or eliminate cost sharing requirements for applied research and development as necessary and appropriate. Moreover, the Secretary may reduce cost sharing requirements for demonstration and commercial application activities as necessary and appropriate, taking into consideration any technological risk relating to the activity. Mr. Speaker, based on the S&P Global macroeconomic model completed on January 5th, it is expected that the U.S. real GDP will grow by 0.5 percent in 2023, with economic growth returning after contraction in the first quarter of 2023. In 2024, the estimated real GDP will grow by 1.9 percent, driven primarily by an increase in household consumption. This means that there will be relatively flat economic growth in 2023 resulting in total U.S. energy consumption falling by 0.9 percent in the forecast. However, total energy consumption then rises by 1.0 percent in 2024. This evidence provides us a basis for making sure we have the proper standards in place for effective accounting for key departments performing various research, development, and demonstration projects. As a senior Member of the Budget Committee, I understand the importance of providing clarity and transparency to the American people on the allocation of funds. I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of H.R. 342, ``The Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2023'' so we can provide transparency to the American people while addressing the proper implementations towards efficient allotment of cost-sharing.",
              "I thank my colleague, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas) for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 342, the Cost- Sharing Accountability Act. Mr. Speaker, research and development grants in the field of energy administered by the Department of Energy play a critical role in innovation and energy research in the United States. The administration and awarding of those grants is governed by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Among other things, that act requires the DOE to impose a cost share on the recipients of those grants. That cost share can be as low as 20 percent in the case of research and development grants, or as high as 50 percent in the case of commercialization and demonstration grants. The purpose of this cost share is simple. It is to ensure that the grant recipients also have some skin in the game when it comes to ensuring the success of the grants and the projects that they are bidding on and demonstrating. Several months ago, the Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology held an oversight hearing in which we investigated the occasions on which the Department of Energy had waived those cost-sharing requirements on grants that it had awarded. The DOE has the statutory ability to waive those cost shares under the appropriate circumstances. We wanted to make sure that that authority was being exercised judiciously. Although we found that the DOE was appropriately waiving those cost shares under those circumstances, we were very surprised by the lack of transparency in that process and equally surprised by the difficulty with which the subcommittee had in acquiring the information about how often the DOE was waiving those cost shares. Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 342, is a very simple solution to that problem. It will require the DOE to make quarterly reports to the committees of jurisdiction in both the House and the Senate on the occasions and the circumstances under which it waives cost-share requirements for the grants that it awards. This will enhance Congress' ability to exercise oversight over the DOE. Equally importantly, it will impose greater transparency into this process for the parties that apply for these grants, and it will demonstrate the circumstances under which the DOE would consider waiving those cost-share requirements. Mr. Speaker, this is basic good governance. It is an oversight bill. I hope it is something that we all on both sides of the aisle can support. I thank my cosponsor, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster), for his leadership on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 342."

              "I rise in support of this amendment. The provisions of this bill, such as Representative Graves' BUILDER Act, would streamline the inefficient and costly NEPA process. It is costly in more than just dollars. It is costly to our environment. It is costly in human lives. As the gentleman explained, we can do better managing our forests. When we keep these forests healthy, we are protecting human life. We are protecting property. We are also protecting the very, very thing that does more to support and help the environment than anything else, and it is our forest. It is a tragedy that we send up so much of our forest in smoke. This NEPA process, although it is streamlining, will help to produce more domestic energy. It will also help to build infrastructure. It will help to take care of our national forest and Federal lands. Mr. Speaker, this is a good amendment. I support it, and I encourage others to support it.",
              "I thank the chairman for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, this administration's regulatory assault on American energy production has been devastating for my constituents in the Central Valley. Every week, I hear from my neighbors, friends, and constituents about the skyrocketing price of monthly energy bills. Over the summer, people in California were paying over $6 per gallon for gas. It is unacceptable that even though America has some of the greatest energy resources of any nation in the world, my constituents are having trouble putting gas in their tanks and food on their tables. That is why I am proud to support the Lower Energy Costs Act, and I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same. This bill will cut red tape and allow us to increase our supply of safe, clean, and affordable energy. I am proud that language from my bill, the NEPA Adequacy Streamlining Act, is included in this bill. This makes the approval of new energy projects easier by allowing the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to use previously conducted environmental assessments for similar projects. This is a commonsense reform that removes one of the many layers of bureaucratic red tape in our permitting process. This bill is full of the same types of policies that streamline our energy production to increase our supply of clean, affordable energy. I want to respond to some of the opponents of this bill. My Democratic colleagues claim that this legislation is harmful to our environment. This is just not true. America has some of the strictest environmental standards of any nation in the world. When we produce energy here, we do it cleaner and safer than countries we would be importing it from. Something important to remember is that decreasing domestic production does not reduce the demand for energy. Reducing our ability to produce oil and gas in the U.S. just increases our reliance on foreign countries for these imports. That means instead of using clean energy we produce here and creating good-paying American jobs in the process, we are reliant on imports from countries like Russia and Venezuela that are not held to the same environmental standards we have here in the U.S. If your argument is that you want to reduce emissions, then increasing U.S. energy production is how you do it. Despite wishes from the President and the far left, we cannot abandon traditional energy sources like oil and gas. While we as a country should continue to develop and pursue other energy sources, we will still need oil and gas for a long time. Why not produce it here in the U.S.? I support an all-of-the-above approach to energy production and use, but that does not mean immediately transitioning to 100 percent renewable fuels. Until alternative energy sources are more reliable, we will continue to need transitional fuels. If my Democratic colleagues cared about the environment as much as they say they do, then supporting the increased production of clean and reliable American-made energy should be a no-brainer. Passing the Lower Energy Costs Act is a critical step to lowering prices, creating good-paying jobs, and strengthening our national security. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill.",
              "everything around us that makes our lives possible is either mined, or it is grown. Everything. Above the Speaker's chair is a plea from Daniel Webster to those who serve in this House. ``Let us develope the resources of our land, call forth its powers . . . and see whether we also, in our day and generation may not perform something worthy to be remembered.'' Yet, for 50 years, the environmental left has slowly strangled our Nation's ability to do just that. In the process, it is impoverishing the American people. One of its most powerful weapons is the National Environmental Policy Act imposed in 1969 with the promise that it would protect the environment. It has done exactly the opposite. It has made it endlessly time consuming and ultimately cost prohibitive to manage our forests, to provide abundant water for our people, and to prosper from our vast energy and mineral resources. My district comprises the forests of the Sierra Nevada and the agricultural heartland of California's Central Valley. The left promised us that NEPA would protect our forests and water resources. Come to my district, and you will see what a cruel and demonstrable lie that has become. Excess timber is removed from our forests in only two ways. If we don't carry it out, nature will burn it out. Throughout the 20th century, the U.S. Forest Service marked off surplus timber and auctioned it to logging companies that paid us to remove it. The result was healthy, resilient, and fire-resistant Federal forests, a steady revenue source for forest improvements, and thriving mountain economies. Then came the National Environmental Policy Act. Simple forest thinning projects now require an average of 4\\1/2\\ years of environmental studies, costing millions of dollars, more than the value of the timber. Instead of making money for the government, removing excess timber now costs us money. As a result, our forests have become morbidly overgrown, carrying four times the timber that the land can support. In that stressed condition, the trees succumb to disease, pestilence, drought, and ultimately catastrophic wildfires we haven't seen in over a century. California is one of the most water-rich regions of the country. Yet, the farms of the Central Valley have had their water systematically choked off because NEPA and other environmental laws make major new reservoirs all but impossible to build. Record rainfall this year is being lost to the ocean simply because we have no place to store it. When the little town of Foresthill tried to add a $2 million spillway gate for additional water storage, they discovered that because of NEPA, they also had to budget an additional $1 million for environmental reviews and $2 million for environmental mitigation. After more than a decade, the project has yet to be built. The last reservoir over a million acre-feet constructed in California was completed in 1979. Meanwhile, the State's population has nearly doubled. Mr. Speaker, when something is plentiful, it is cheap. When it is scarce, it is expensive. NEPA is making everything we depend upon in our lives increasingly scarce, and therefore, increasingly expensive. The left obsesses over a 1-degree rise in temperature over the next century, but they couldn't care less that they are making it impossible for people to heat their homes in subfreezing winters. They promise us they care about the environment, but they couldn't care less that entire human communities' and species' habitats and millions of acres of forest are being laid to waste by preventable mega fires. They obsess over the snail darter but couldn't care less that they have destroyed thousands of agricultural jobs, idled a half million acres of California farmland, and sent grocery prices skyrocketing. They promised us that NEPA would protect our forests. Instead, it is destroying them. H.R. 1 begins to dial back the damage that NEPA has done, both to the environment and to the quality of life of all Americans, simply by reducing the time and cost required for these massive bureaucratic studies. The question before us is whether our children will grow up in a world of scarcity, poverty, and misery or one of abundance, prosperity, and optimism. That is the simple question before us. We choose prosperity; a future of abundant and affordable energy, water, food, lumber, minerals, and all the material comforts and benefits that flow from the resources our country has been blessed with. That is something worthy to be remembered, and that future can begin with this vote today."

              "my amendment is simple in that it would improve the transparency of the process around the development of the plan required in the underlying bill. Like other regulatory processes where public input is required, my amendment would require the Secretary to provide for an opportunity for at least a 90-day public comment period on the plan. If Congress is going to open up more Federal land for oil and gas production, we must hear from the communities and stakeholders that would be affected by most of these projects. This amendment simply gives an opportunity for the public to offer their views and knowledge for the Secretary to consider in the formation of any plan. Oil and gas drilling can be a terribly destructive process for the environment and the communities around these drilling sites. The individuals and families who must live near drilling sites are forced to experience the harsh day-to-day realities of air and water quality impacts, which can lead to increased risks of developing asthma, respiratory disease, cancer, and other harmful side effects. If the Secretary is going to recommend a plan to expand more drilling, then we should hear from experts, stakeholders, and others who have a vested interest and allow them to participate openly and honestly in the process. This is a simple, good-governance amendment. We are elected to Congress by the people, and it is the people who are affected who deserve a say in what happens in their communities. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I heard my colleague from our committee say that this was a perfecting amendment, and what I see it as is just a more bureaucracy amendment. The problem here with the underlying bill is that it basically makes it impossible for the President to use--to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when there is an emergency in order to lower prices or to increase the supply. What this amendment does is to put even more restrictions or make it even more likely that a delay would occur because the gentleman says that the plan required would include a list of parcels planned to be offered for lease, including for each parcel, the size of the parcel by acre, the location of the parcel, any permits and approvals necessary to access the parcel, and produce oil and gas on the parcel. Look, the bottom line is what it appears the sponsor wants is for the Federal Government to spend its limited time during a crisis looking over maps of critical public lands and drawing arbitrary lines instead of taking rapid actions to lower gas prices for everyday families. The underlying bill doesn't work because it puts all kinds of restrictions on the President's ability to use the reserve, either to lower prices, or to increase the supply in an emergency, and this amendment only makes it worse. It would throw more barriers to the Secretary using the reserve to protect American families and businesses. It is so shortsighted, considering how critical the Biden administration's use of the reserve has been following Putin's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent global gas shortages. For a minority so concerned--I should say in this case, for a Republican majority so concerned with cutting red tape, this amendment would create quite a few unnecessary hoops for the Secretary to jump through before taking swift action to help Americans. It just makes no sense. Again, over the past year, the Biden administration has demonstrated that in an emergency, in an energy crisis, strategic use of the reserve can bring relief to the pump for millions of Americans, and this amendment puts that record of success by the Biden administration in jeopardy. So I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment and, of course, a ``no'' vote on final passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment is simple and straightforward. My amendment simply requires the administration to submit their plan to increase oil and gas production on Federal lands to the House Committees on Armed Services, Agriculture, and Energy and Commerce and Natural Resources, as well as the Senate Committees on Energy and Natural Resources, Environment and Public Works, Armed Services, and Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. This simple, good-governance amendment allows Congress to take back its Article I authority in our system of checks and balances. Without my amendment, the plan to bolster our domestic energy supply will be filed away and never seen again. This amendment will provide transparency for the administration to carry out its congressionally authorized duty. More than 55 percent of my Congressional District is Federal land and accounts for nearly 44 percent of Colorado's natural gas production. The underlying bill requires the administration to be responsible for their actions. If Joe Biden and Secretary Granholm continue to dip into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, they must have a plan in place to increase oil and gas production on land that has been locked up and overregulated by the Federal Government. That plan should be submitted to the congressional committees of jurisdiction. By requiring the administration to submit its plan to the people's House, we can provide important oversight as to how the administration will carry out this plan and provide feedback. On the Western Slope of Colorado, we have seen firsthand the harm leftist policies have created in our communities, literally regulating our communities into poverty. With the stroke of his pen, Joe Biden unilaterally locked up Federal lands for oil and gas production and development. Colorado's Western Slope used to have a booming energy production economy. We used to have 112 drilling rigs on the Western Slope, and now we have 4. These extreme leftist policies to lock up land have driven away those good-paying jobs and have helped drive up gas prices. Congress needs to take back its power and advocate for the American people they represent. My amendment will ensure those voices do not go unheard and that we will hold the administration accountable for the responsible energy plan required by this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "the gentleman says that this building is powered by natural gas. I think it is probably more accurate to say it is powered by hot air. Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is that this bill is a giveaway to the oil companies. The gentleman says he doesn't trust Big Oil, but this is a bill that gives them everything they want--their wish list. Trust the markets? I don't know that the market can clean up a toxic waste dump or the market can clean up an oil spill or the market can monitor clean air. The bottom line is this bill goes after all of those protections and actually endangers the American people. To the gentleman from Pennsylvania, who I hope will read more quotes because I think it is making it clear--which is shocking in the year 2023--he is making the case that climate change doesn't exist going all the way back to Al Gore, who actually was right when he said that climate change was a problem, and selectively taking these quotes from way back when. Does anybody believe that climate change isn't real? Come to Massachusetts. I will introduce you to my farmers who complain about the impacts of climate change on their ability to make a livelihood. Maple syrup producers wonder whether they will be able to get maple syrup out of trees in Massachusetts because of climate change. I could go on and on about the impacts of climate change on our local farmers. Much of this discussion, Mr. Speaker, can be tied back to Republicans' affinity for culture wars. They just claimed a little while ago that President Biden and Democrats were planning to come after Americans' gas stoves. It couldn't be further from the truth. No one is taking your stove. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a Vox article titled: ``Five myths about gas stoves, the latest culture war clash.''",
              "I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 1, and I urge my colleagues to vote against this dangerous and irresponsible bill. With extreme weather events becoming more and more frequent, and climate change impacting our communities, agriculture, homes, and even our national security, we need to work together to advance climate rescue measures that move the U.S. away from fossil fuel dependence, protect workers and communities, and strengthen environmental protections, all while reducing costs to the American people. This can't happen overnight, but instead of building upon the historic, deficit-reducing provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, Republicans are trying to roll back that historic bill, and in the process they are putting polluters over people and the planet. H.R. 1 restricts community input by gutting NEPA. It forces the sell- off of public lands and undermines the health of all Americans by compromising air and water quality, all while adding billions to our national debt. Of particular interest in my district is that this bill would block the EPA from requiring refineries to study alternatives to the use of hydrofluoric acid--or HF--in fossil fuel processing. HF has the potential to form a poisonous, killing aerosol cloud which can travel for miles if it is released. There have been dozens of accidents involving HF in recent years, including a devastating 2019 explosion and fire at a refinery in my district. That explosion put U.S. steelworkers and tens of thousands of nearby residents at serious risk of death and serious harm. An inspection found that the refinery lacked adequate inspection and safety protocols to prevent a catastrophe. Essentially, it was a miracle that no one died that night. To safeguard against future accidents, I offered a commonsense amendment to this bill that would require refineries with a history of accidents or Clean Air Act violations to study alternatives to HF, but my Republican colleagues refused to allow the amendment. This refusal to consider past disasters to create necessary safety standards tells us exactly what this bill is about: empowering the fossil fuel industry at the expense of worker and community safety. Again, I urge my colleagues to vote against this reckless bill.",
              "I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 1, the polluters over people act. Although energy independence and lower costs are laudable goals for any energy legislation, unfortunately, this bill achieves neither. Instead, H.R. 1 is a giveaway to Big Oil and their lobbyists, who want to be able to set their own rules at the expense of working families. Instead of putting the needs of the American public at the center of this bill, my friends across the aisle drafted an industry wish list. First, H.R. 1 undermines landmark environmental laws and protections like the Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Policy Act that safeguard public health and keep our drinking water and air clean. It also repeals the methane emissions reduction program, which helps companies reduce their methane pollution. This bill makes it easier for polluters to set their own standards and roll back reforms, and it lets Big Oil rubberstamp their own projects with minimal oversight. Environmental disasters are far too common, and unfortunately, H.R. 1 would make it easier for future disasters to happen. Second, the polluters over people act worsens the climate crisis by empowering the fossil fuel industry instead of strengthening the foundation for a clean energy future, which is so important. During the last Congress, the 117th Congress, we passed policies-- many bipartisan policies--like the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, that invested in climate action at a scale matching the challenge that science tells us that we face. This bill that we have before us today not only ignores the additional steps we need to take to reach our climate targets, but it actively takes us backward on climate action by rolling back key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, which was and is the most significant environmental and climate bill that has ever been passed in the United States or anywhere else. We know that data is alarming. A new U.N. report found that global warming could increase by 3.2 degrees Celsius and cause 7 feet of sea level rise by the end of the century if immediate actions are not taken. This is an existential crisis. Climate change is real. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle know it is real, and we cannot continue to deny this and put our planet at risk with this type of legislation. Instead of wasting time on this Big Oil wish list, I would like for us, instead, to focus on actions that will actually expand the employment of clean energy, reduce costs, expand high-capacity transmission, reform the interconnection process, and build on the $1 billion that we secured in the Inflation Reduction Act to ensure that Federal agencies have the resources and expertise to conduct efficient environmental reviews. Third, H.R. 1 adds to the deficit. That is right, it adds to the deficit by giving handouts to big oil and gas corporations so that their executives and their shareholders can get even richer. For a party that is focused--at least, I hear that they are--on tackling the deficit, I think it is pretty extraordinary that this legislation, their signature legislation would add to the deficit. Last year, when Americans were dealing with high costs at the pump, fossil fuel executives were taking in record profits. In fact, 26 of the country's largest oil companies made a record-breaking $451 billion last year, just last year, and they spent over $163 billion on stock buybacks and dividends to their shareholders. These same companies donated over $370,000 to my friends across the aisle, so it is no wonder they want to reward their friends. It is clear that this legislation, the polluters over people act, is another giveaway, to keep corporations rich at the American people's expense without making meaningful reforms. In fact, while making things worse. For all these reasons and more, I strongly oppose this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I proposed four amendments that would begin to correct course, but unfortunately my friends across the aisle are only allowing two of those amendments to come to the floor. My first amendment that was blocked would clarify that lead Federal agencies can extend a public comment period or gather further community input if the Secretary determines that doing so would improve project results or efficiency. This would allow agencies to actually streamline the permitting process by ensuring that potentially impacted communities and local governments have the ability to fully engage in the process. Instead, my friends across the aisle chose to block consideration of this amendment and perpetuate the myth--it is a myth--that community input somehow slows down project approvals. My other amendment that was blocked would have banned offshore drilling off the southern California coast. Californians of both political parties have made it absolutely clear, overwhelmingly clear that they are strongly opposed to additional offshore oil and gas drilling in southern California off the coast. This amendment would have offered this Congress an opportunity to respect the will of the overwhelming majority of Californians who oppose drilling off our coasts. I strongly urge my friends across the aisle, allow debate on these and other amendments so that more voices are heard. As my colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee have heard me say before, I am willing to work with anyone--anyone--on either side of the aisle to meet the goals of lowering energy costs and protecting our planet, particularly in terms of promoting a more efficient and transparent permitting process. I hope we can do that. We can find common ground on pragmatic solutions. This is not common ground. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no.''"

We need to secure our land and not make it available for foreign governments, especially the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP is one of the greatest threats to American democracy and our homeland. Since at least 2007, the Department of Defense has consistently recognized China's dominance in the mining of key minerals as a leading national security threat. The Biden administration is recklessly pursuing a green agenda that makes the United States economy more dependent on critical mined minerals used to make things like batteries. We cannot continue to allow the genocidal CCP to control that supply chain. We certainly must ensure that the CCP cannot expand its market power by controlling mines even in our own country. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of my commonsense amendment for the sake of our people and our national security, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "I rise today to oppose the polluters over people act and the mining provisions that will make it easier for foreign-owned companies to pollute our lands and waters and destroy our Tribal cultural resources. America's 150-year-old mining law already fails to protect our communities from irresponsible mining. We see that in the thousands of abandoned mines that dot New Mexico and the West. H.R. 1 would only make it worse, threatening our water and, as we know, ``agua es vida,'' ``water is life.'' I am disappointed that the Republicans blocked my amendment to stop mining exploration on public lands if it harms our water, farmers, and Tribal communities. Do they not care about our most essential resource, our water? Indeed, some proposed mining projects are from subsidiaries of foreign companies like Resolution Copper in Arizona, which has ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Why are they protecting the Chinese Communist Party's subsidiary mining our precious resources? That mine would devastate Tribal cultural resources and threaten our precious water resources. I urge my colleagues to oppose this polluter over people act.",
              "I rise in support of the amendment. During our markup of this bill in the committee, Representative Gosar offered a similar amendment to this one, though it applied only to oil and gas, not mining. I asked if he would consider adding mining to that ban, but that was declined. I also had an amendment to this bill to include mining in this ban, which was not made in order. However, this Republican amendment, which is very similar to my own, was made in order. I am glad to see that at least some Republicans have come around to the point of including mining as part of the ban. If we don't want the Chinese Communist Party developing oil and gas leases on Federal land and water, then we shouldn't be supportive of the CCP mining our publicly owned minerals. It isn't hard to find that many foreign-owned parent companies have terrible records of human rights abuses, environmental degradation, harming indigenous communities, and destroying sacred sites. Some foreign companies, specifically several owned by the Government of China, are known to have horrible records on all of these fronts, yet they can operate freely on our Federal land, including in my home State of Arizona, through their subsidiaries. I have repeatedly heard from my colleagues that we agree that human rights and environmental abuses are wrong, but so far, they have refused to address the problem. As the demand for these minerals increases, let's not rush to open our lands to just anyone who wants to mine. Let's take a closer look at who is operating on our Federal lands and work to raise the global standard. Let me remind Members that under our outdated 150-year-old mining law, mining claimants do not pay a cent, not one penny, for the public's valuable resources that they extract and turn around and sell--nothing. That is a better deal than even oil and gas get. We absolutely should not be handing our public mineral resources over to the CCP with no fair return to the American people, no return to the American people at all, where the result would be simply just to destroy our lands. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose H.R. 1. H.R. 1 reverses our hard- fought progress for clean water, and it also severely undermines States' abilities to protect water quality under the Clean Water Act. Under this bill, States like California would have their hands tied in their efforts to maintain water quality for drinking, recreation, and protecting our natural environments. California has always been a leader in clean water issues, and this bill is a direct assault on our efforts to counteract pollution and protect both public health and the health of the environment. What is more, H.R. 1 will dangerously limit States from protecting their own natural resources and bodies of water. It will limit California's efforts to conserve water, which is especially important given the extreme drought that we were in and will continue to see in the face of changing climate. Maintaining section 401 of the Clean Water Act is vital. My friends on the other side of the aisle claim the proposed changes in the bill will prevent States from hijacking the permitting process and preventing important energy projects. However, in the past 50 years, California State water agencies have processed thousands of section 401 permit requests without issue. Only a handful each year are denied. The States have utilized this section to rightfully protect against violations of their own State water quality standards. We see this legislation for what it truly is: a giveaway to corporate polluters at the expense of our environment. Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this bill and the larger movement it stands for. We cannot and should not roll back these bedrock environmental laws.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, which includes the Water Quality Certification and Energy Project Improvement Act. That bill is the one that I introduced alongside my friend and colleague from Louisiana, Mr. Garret Graves. One of many key components in this package, this specific part of the bill helps ensure development of our Nation's energy infrastructure at a time when it is most necessary. This is accomplished by clarifying that projects subject to section 401 of the Clean Water Act are approved or denied based on water quality alone. Unlike what my colleagues have been saying on the other side of the aisle that we are going to permit dirty water, et cetera, et cetera, if it is related to water, guess what, section 401 still applies. The water quality certification process has been and continues to be weaponized by certain States to stifle important energy projects they oppose, particularly pipelines, for political reasons completely unrelated to water quality and outside the scope and the intent of the Clean Water Act. That is all this particular provision addresses. Instead of fairly analyzing a project based on the Federal standards set forth by Congress, what has happened is States on the East and West Coast have increasingly weaponized section 401 for their own ideological purposes, again totally and completely unrelated to water quality. Here are some examples: In my home State of North Carolina, the Mountain Valley Southgate project was denied, not because of water quality but because the deciding bureaucrats hold an inherent opposition to the project as a whole. Projects in Washington and New York have been denied due to noise and cultural resources. Nothing to do with water quality. These are just a few examples of the weaponization of section 401 of the Clean Water Act statute. The language that is included here in this package quite simply will end this abuse. At a time when American energy production and distribution is under tremendous assault from some in this country, ensuring that America can build the energy infrastructure necessary to responsibly utilize our natural resources, unleash American energy independence, and lower costs for American families is a top priority that this broader bill achieves. Let me put it this way: Low cost, reliable energy is fundamental to prosperity. It isn't the only critical aspect necessary for a nation and her people to be prosperous, but it is awfully hard for a nation to be prosperous without it. Low cost and reliable energy helps America to produce more goods and therefore put downward pressure on inflation, and, boy, do we need all the help we can get. It will enable America to be energy dominant again, increasing American strength abroad. Put another way, it is critical to our economy, our food security, and our national security. That is why this legislation is so badly needed at this critical time in American history. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Lower Energy Costs Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of clean water and in support of the Clean Water Act, and in opposition to H.R. 1, the polluters over people act. Clean water is a basic human right--the health and safety of our communities and the success of our economy depends on it. House Democrats stand for clean water. Last Congress, we passed a historic and bipartisan investment in our Nation's infrastructure through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The BIL included almost $13 billion in clean water infrastructure upgrades and is creating jobs in communities across the country. The Clean Water Act, passed in 1972, is one of the most successful environmental laws in our Nation's history. It has protected rivers, lakes, and streams from pollution and contamination, ensuring that we have access to clean and safe water. Section 401 of the Clean Water Act allows States to review projects that could impact their water quality. For 50 years, States have used this authority to protect their water resources, and it has helped them ensure that projects move forward only if clean water would not be compromised as a result. These proposals that are in H.R. 1, to narrow the scope of section 401, are a misguided effort at permitting reform. By limiting the ability of States to review projects, we are sacrificing the health of our communities and our environment for the sake of expedience and profit. I recognize the majority's interest in ensuring that permitting requirements are not insurmountable barriers to investment. I share the goal of speeding up project delivery. Last Congress, I supported not only the BIL, but also the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. These laws showed what Congress is capable of when it focuses on addressing the real needs of American families. I want these laws and their investments to be successful. However, to quickly put these investments to work, we need a robust partnership between the Federal Government and its State and local partners and Tribal partners, to address State, local, and Tribal requirements, and to ensure community buy-in before these investments are implemented. To be effective, that process must build on a mutual trust between the parties because any effort to force that process often results in opposition, delay, and litigation. Yet, H.R. 1 misses the mark by stifling local participation and buy- in, which will only result in these projects taking longer to implement. In fact, State organizations, such as the Western States Water Council, believe that placing arbitrary and strict limits on section 401 application review times and processes will require the States ``to issue an increased number of denials, due to inflexible deadlines that do not accommodate State public engagement laws or allow sufficient time to gather adequate information on project impacts.'' Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 1, and reject the efforts to weaken the Clean Water Act and our Nation's other bedrock environmental laws. We must protect our water resources for future generations and for the health of today's communities and families. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "I thank the gentleman for yielding. H.R. 1 will unleash domestic energy production and reverse the Biden- led Democrat assault on American energy. Democrat punitive policies have led to record-high gas prices, limited supply, and unrelenting inflation. Folks back home in Michigan are yearning for leadership that has been sorely lacking in Washington these past couple of years. H.R. 1 will streamline permitting, open up new markets to export natural gas, and repeal billions in inflationary Green New Deal giveaways. H.R. 1 will also protect the land we live on, the water we drink, and the air we breathe. Of great importance to me and my constituents is the provision continuing the longstanding ban on drilling in our Great Lakes. As the Representative for the district with the longest shoreline in the lower 48 States, including three of the five Great Lakes, I will continue to fight and defend our Great Lakes for future generations. As we talk energy, I live in the middle of copper country. As this board shows, we need to control for our future the precious metals necessary for what we do.",
              "the Great Lakes are a national treasure and a regional economic driver for all of us in the Midwest. The lakes account for more than 90 percent of our Nation's surface water and 20 percent of the surface freshwater on the planet. More than 30 million Americans rely on the Great Lakes for their drinking water. For generations, there has been a deeply held bipartisan consensus on the need to protect the Great Lakes: from invasive species, from environmental challenges, and from irresponsible development. Look no further than the broad bipartisan support for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. I want to work with my colleagues in making progress to protect our Great Lakes, not to open the door--even the slightest crack--for dangerous development. That is why today I offer an amendment to clearly reiterate our vital protections of these Great Lakes. My amendment ensures that H.R. 21 would continue the bipartisan consensus that there will be no exploration, development, or drilling for oil and gas in the Great Lakes. With nearly 1 in 10 Americans relying on the Great Lakes for drinking water, we must ensure that a disaster like the Deepwater Horizon ever happening in Lake Michigan is not only unfathomable, but impossible. This amendment ensures that that is the case. Today, we must say with one unified bipartisan voice that there will never be drilling in the Great Lakes. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I would like to start off by applauding my colleagues for including language in H.R. 1 that reaffirms our Nation's commitment to protecting freshwater resources, especially the Great Lakes. This bill upholds our commitment to protecting our natural resources in Michigan and upholding the ban on oil and gas development in our Great Lakes. We are blessed with rich waterways and have an obligation to protect them. We talk a lot about becoming energy independent, but what does this mean for our country and the American people? It starts with access to essential resources without relying on the goodwill of foreign nations, especially our adversaries. Mining is essential to our energy strategy and manufacturing independence. Without independent, secure, and safe minerals, there is no manufacturing independence. Worse, there is no national security. I put forward the national strategy to reshore mineral supply chains amendment because I believe it is one of those commonsense issues that both sides can agree on. Democrats have advocated for an electric future. That hinges on sustainably sourced mining. Republicans have made it clear that establishing energy and manufacturing independence to grow our economy and lower prices is a top priority. I have actually found a bipartisan partner in the White House. Last week, I asked Secretary Blinken whether he would be open to participating with me on legislation to create a 21st century national strategy to strengthen the American industrial base to reshore our critical minerals and end slavery in our supply chains. His answer? We welcome working with you on that. This amendment is a practical step toward that goal. To the Chinese Communist Party, my amendment signals that America is done being taken advantage of. To the rest of the world, it shows that America stands strong and strategically. To hardworking Americans, it means lower costs and more money in their pockets. I represent the number one manufacturing district in the country, but our Great Lakes are table stakes for anyone who seeks to represent them. We must have balance in how we approach this, and I believe H.R. 1 strikes that balance. America has leaned on the 10th Congressional District in a world war and a global pandemic, and we expect to be called upon again. We will stand ready to help, but we must be prepared. That starts with a national strategy to reshore mineral supply chains. It is critically important."

We love our coastal playground. We respect our coastal communities. And that is why we must fight to protect them--not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Oregonians who cherish our environment and our people. Oregon led with the first-ever ``Bottle Bill'' to reduce litter on the beaches. Oregon led when it made its coastline free and open to the public. Now we must lead the fight against offshore drilling, which threatens our coastline, the people who call it home, and fisheries and families who depend on it for their livelihoods, and our environment. Offshore drilling is a mistake, and it will only exacerbate our energy and environmental crisis down the road. We must say ``no'' by voting ``yes'' on this amendment.",
              "my district includes 250 miles of entirely public beaches on a coastline renowned for its pristine and rugged beauty. Our fishing community relies on clean oceans. It is our responsibility to protect these waters that are vital for our coastal economies and ocean ecosystems. It is my duty to protect our oceans, the livelihood of the fishing industry on the Oregon coast, and the way of life for the next generation of coastal Oregonians. The fossil fuel industry has 2,000 leases covering 12 million acres for offshore drilling that are currently not being used. This is just bait and switch by the oil companies who are making record profits while they are price gouging Americans at the gas pump. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support Representative DelBene's amendment to protect Oregon and Washington's coast for future generations.",
              "I rise to offer an amendment prohibiting oil and gas leasing on any tract of the Washington-Oregon Planning Area, where leasing would negatively impact coastal fisheries. The health of our economies depends on a clean Pacific. Washington generates over $8.5 billion of revenue in fisheries and seafood processing a year. My district is home to one of the most fishing- dependent communities in the entire U.S. Pacific County is home to the largest shellfish-producing community on the entire West Coast. Pacific County produces almost 50 million pounds of shellfish a year. That is 600 jobs and over $10 million of value. The towns of Ilwaco and Chinook support over 200 fishing vessels. That is 1,300 jobs, generating 21 million pounds of fish and shellfish and $25 million of personal income. To be clear, this is critical to the economies of our coastal communities. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve will continue to be a critical part of our national security infrastructure, and oil and gas will continue to be part of our energy economy for a long time, but we can't sacrifice our rural economies for a one-off jackpot in oil. I am proud to offer this amendment to protect coastal fisheries and the communities they support, and I am glad to stand up for people who work for a living. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

              "I believe I have made it very clear that this bill is deeply flawed from the concept to execution. While I really do hesitate to improve a bad bill, I think it is important that we acknowledge one of the bill's starkest omissions. My amendment would simply require that while developing the plan this bill proposes, the relevant Secretaries also develop a plan to consult with Tribal Governments. This is particularly important as the bill could open up an additional 300 million acres of new oil and gas extraction on public lands. If we really intend to give away an area three times the size of California to Big Oil, then we need to understand the impact it will have on communities across the West starting with those who have stewarded these lands since time immemorial. It is essential that the Secretaries fully and meaningfully consult with Tribal Governments to understand the impact this extractive development would have on Tribal communities from damaging air and water to destroying sacred sites. For too long, Tribal Governments have been excluded from Federal decisionmaking processes. We have seen the impact of that omission as homelands are degraded, sacred sites destroyed, and Tribal communities are forced to bear the brunt of pollution. A no more important example is the example of uranium contamination that continues and the cleanup of uranium contamination that continues in around the Grand Canyon and Navajo Nation, and that has affected that community and the Navajo people for generations. It is unacceptable that we would turn a blind eye to these impacts. Tribal Governments need to be at the table from the start helping to shape decisions that impact their communities and their ancestral lands. This amendment would ensure that they do just that while helping to uphold the Federal Government's trust responsibility. This shouldn't be controversial. In fact, this should have been built in from the start. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment requires local units of the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Forest Service to open job positions related to permitting or natural resources, including at local high schools, community colleges, universities, and other institutions. Mr. Speaker, I just have to commend the gentlewoman's district. I was recently in the town of Hobbs, New Mexico, and I got to visit an amazing facility called CTECH that is used to educate future workers in that area. I have seen a lot of career and technical education facilities, and this one is second to none. It was funded by the industry in the oil and gas business. They gave back to the community and built this remarkable facility. I believe they said over 1,000 high school students per year are using this facility. These are the places that are educating these future workers, and these jobs should be advertised there. We have heard from multiple sectors, including in the energy, mining, and renewable energy spaces, about the permitting challenges they face, and those challenges are magnified by a lack of sufficient qualified personnel in State and local land management offices. This amendment tasks the administration with performing outreach to local schools and other institutions to help fill open positions in their local offices. While it is far from a total solution to the permitting challenges in our country, this amendment could help improve permitting backlogs and provide employment opportunities at the local level, including in rural areas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",
              "I appreciate the opportunity to debate and consider my amendment to encourage local hiring and recruitment, but I also want to note my disappointment that my friends across the aisle rejected any consideration of my other two amendments on this floor. One of those amendments would allow the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to prevent exploratory mining from taking place on Federal land if it would negatively impact our water, farmers, Tribes, or local communities. In New Mexico, ``agua es vida''; ``water is life.'' It shouldn't be controversial to protect our waters from mining contamination for our people, farmers, and environment. My other amendment would have simply stated that this bill would not go into effect until the Federal Government certified that it would lower costs for American consumers and save taxpayers money. If this bill is really designed to lower energy costs for American consumers and taxpayers, let's verify that before putting polluters over people. Again, I appreciate the opportunity to consider my amendment, which would require local units of the Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, and National Park Service to conduct an outreach plan to disseminate and advertise local civil service positions with functions relating to permitting and natural resources in their offices. Each plan must include outreach to local high schools, community colleges, institutions of higher education, and other relevant institutions. The BLM, the Forest Service, and the National Park Service field offices, and ranger districts and sites are stewards of our lands and waters, but they also operate within communities within which they are located, whether it is Cuba or Farmington or Roswell, New Mexico. Adequate staffing at these offices and their headquarters, and our Federal agencies more broadly, is critical to our ability to effectively steward our natural resources and environment and move projects through the permitting process efficiently, responsibly, and with an ear tuned in to what the local communities need. Unfortunately, we are seeing many of our agencies struggle to fill vacancies and staff up. For example, an E&E News article from last year said there are vacancy counts for all BLM State offices; the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho; the Bureau's National Operations Center in Denver; and the other directorates. To be clear, I know BLM and other Federal agencies are working hard to address these challenges. My amendment would take another step to help address the staffing challenges by making sure local offices are communicating with the local communities about open positions. Whether it is New Mexico Highlands University, Eastern New Mexico University, or Navajo Tech, I believe we should be taking advantage of talent in the communities where these offices are located. To be clear, once again, we must also provide our Federal agencies with the resources and tools they need and support our Federal workforce along the way. The investments made last Congress to increase capacity at our Federal permitting offices were a downpayment, but we need to continue to invest in agency capability. Again, this amendment simply makes sure that our local agencies are thinking about communicating with our local talent when trying to fill those hiring challenges. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time."

              "the gentleman appears to be fixated on undermining key EPA safeguards put in place over the last 15 years under the guise of being too costly, while the history of environmental protection, especially under the Clean Air Act, shows this is simply untrue. The United States can have both a clean environment and a strong economy. It is a false choice to assume otherwise. Republicans who claim that ambitious climate action and economic prosperity are at odds are simply ignoring the facts. This is the same argument that industry has used every time the Clean Air Act has been strengthened, and it has been debunked each and every time. When Congress debated the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, the oil industry said, ``The technology to meet these standards simply does not exist today,'' and predicted major supply disruptions, while chemical companies said the law would cause severe economic and social disruption. None of these gloom-and-doom predictions has ever come true. Instead, our air got cleaner, and our economy flourished. The history of the Clean Air Act shows that the United States can reduce carbon pollution while creating jobs and strengthening our economy. Since its adoption in 1970, the Clean Air Act has reduced key air pollutants by roughly 78 percent, while the economy has almost quadrupled in size. By EPA's own estimates, the benefits derived from the Clean Air Act exceed costs by a factor of more than 30-1. Let that sink in for a minute. Republicans like to claim that protecting Americans from pollution and tackling the climate crisis will sink the United States economy, but time and time again, we have seen that economic prosperity and environmental protection do go hand in hand. The Clean Air Act has also made the United States the world leader in pollution control technology, generating hundreds of billions of dollars for U.S. companies and creating millions of jobs. The standards targeted by this amendment are also widely popular: Clean car standards that help Americans drive cleaner and more fuel- efficient vehicles; mercury and air toxics standards that clean up deadly mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from power plants; and methane standards for the oil and gas sector that are supported by industry. The polluters over people act is the latest in a long line of sad attempts to undermine critical environmental and public health protections. These tired arguments continue to ring false and hollow. This amendment is more of the same. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose it and yield back the balance of my time.",
              "a common refrain that I hear from Republicans is that unilateral action by the United States to reduce greenhouse gases would harm our economy and wouldn't move the needle on reducing global emissions. The core of this argument is that if we are going to address climate change, we need to coordinate an international response. Of course, this argument completely falls apart when you take a look at the actions of the House Republicans. Many cheered as the previous administration removed the United States from the Paris Agreement. Exiting the largest international agreement to combat global climate change not only weakened our diplomatic standing abroad, but it made it abundantly clear that Republicans don't care about addressing climate change. Now, thankfully, President Biden rejoined the Paris Agreement, putting that embarrassing chapter behind us, but it appears that House Republicans want to go back to burying their heads in the sand when it comes to combating climate change, as was made clear by this amendment. This amendment would repeal section 115 of the Clean Air Act, which provides EPA with a tool to address air pollution while promoting international cooperation to combat climate change. As my Republican colleagues should know by now, air pollution does not respect boundaries, whether these are State or international. Section 115 provides the EPA administrator the authority to set limits on an air pollutant that is harming public health and welfare in another country as long as the other country grants reciprocal rights to the United States. The gentleman's amendment would remove this discretionary authority, gutting our ability to cooperate with our neighbors. We have agreements with Canada and with Mexico, and we show leadership with the international community by working with our neighbors to try to deal with air pollution. Climate change is a global problem. We need to work with other nations like we worked with Canada and Mexico and provide the leadership to encourage international engagements to tackle this crisis. I have to say: I don't believe the Republican majority wants to act on climate crisis internationally or domestically. Case in point, the polluters over people act we are dealing with today. It attempts to repeal popular provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act: The greenhouse gas reduction fund, the methane emissions reduction program, and $4.5 billion in home electrification rebates. Now, House Democrats took historic action to combat the climate crisis by passing the Inflation Reduction Act, which included unparalleled investments in climate and clean energy. Not a single House Republican voted for it, but if we can't act domestically and we can't act in coordination with our neighbors, even Canada and Mexico, what are we going to do to address the threat caused by the climate crisis? According to this amendment, the answer is apparently nothing. We are not going to do anything domestically. We are not going to do anything with our neighbors. We are not going to do anything internationally. We are going to do nothing. I just think that is unacceptable. At a time of real crisis, as highlighted by the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report, we should empower EPA to combat dangerous climate change and strongly encourage other nations to do the same. We shouldn't be taking any tools off the table, and that is what this amendment does. It takes the tool off the table. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "this amendment repeals section 115 of the Clean Air Act. This vital amendment protects the autonomy of the States over their own energy sectors by ensuring that unelected, unaccountable EPA bureaucrats cannot seize control over these vital industries under the guise of emissions reductions. The Constitution clearly reserves this power to the States, and it is long overdue that we bring Federal policies back in line with the very Constitution that we swore an oath to. Section 115 gives EPA the authority to impose emission reductions on the States if the administrator finds, based on the word of some international organization--just based on their good word--that American air pollution endangers the public health and welfare of another country. Imagine if we could do that to China? The administrator determines that that country will lower their emissions a commensurate amount. Put a different way, section 115 allows the EPA to rely on the credibility of the same international elites who misled us about COVID to force our constituents to change every aspect of their lives because some European nation thought it would be great to do the same thing. Now, we would have to do the same thing. This is no longer a hypothetical. Since President Biden reentered the Paris climate agreement, it can be argued that these conditions have been met and EPA can immediately impose devastating requirements as it was argued when the Obama administration first entered the agreement. Subjecting such an important sector of our economy to the whims of foreign bureaucrats is downright reckless and hands U.S. sovereignty over to a foreign ideologue--not even foreign governments, just foreign bureaucrats. Removing the broadly written language in section 115 is the only way to prevent the delegation of nearly unlimited power over State energy sectors to the EPA bureaucrats and removes the ability of international organizations to meddle in our energy sector. It is vital that we prevent this Federal power grab before it imposes devastating economic consequences by empowering the States to meet the needs and interests of their own citizens. Language to prevent the use of section 115 of the Clean Air Act has passed the House three times under Republican majorities: Twice in the 115th Congress and once in the 114th. To those who view this amendment as premature because the administration has not yet acted under section 115, the impact was never questioned in the past. How many times do we have to wake up and say, well, I didn't think they would do it? I didn't think they would actually defund the police. I didn't think they would have the IRS show up at the guy's house when he was testifying in Congress. Heaven forbid, I didn't believe they would actually try and ban my gas stove. I thought they were just kidding around. They didn't really mean it. They do mean it. We know the administration is going to do so because the radical environmental groups that control their agenda have come out and said it. Here are a couple examples. The League of Conservation Voters: ``While there has been limited use of section 115, numerous scholars have advocated for its use as a pathway to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly since the Paris Agreement.'' How about Foreign Policy for America: This amendment would undermine EPA's authority for ``its potential future applications to greenhouse gases.'' Yeah, we want to undermine their authority and make the authority of the States preeminent. The authority of citizens should be preeminent. Preemptively removing this authority from the administration before they can act is vital to U.S. sovereignty and our economic well-being. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time."

              "this amendment simply extends existing reporting requirements. The underlying section allows the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to accept and expend funds from non- Federal entities in order to pay for staff and information technology system development to expedite permit processing. They are authorized to accept funds in fiscal years 2023 through 2025. In the original bill text, both Secretaries are required to submit annual statements to the committees of jurisdiction explaining why one or both of the following scenarios occurs: They do not accept funds contributed; or They accept but do not expend the funds contributed. This amendment adds the requirement that both Secretaries submit a report to the committee of jurisdiction that includes, for each expenditure authorized: The amount of funds accepted, and The contributing non-Federal entity. I know most folks probably don't read these reports, and they throw them in a pile. However, for future oversight efforts, it is important for the U.S. Congress to both specifically enumerate that agencies retain this information and then require them to provide it to us so not only we can see it but the American people can see how the money is being spent and who is spending it and who is giving it. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.",
              "again, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding. I do rise in support of this amendment. H.R. 1 would allow non-Federal entities to provide money to certain Federal agencies to improve permitting efficiency. This good-governance amendment, offered by my friend from Pennsylvania, would require the Secretaries who accept this money to report on where it came from and how much was provided. I think there is some confusion about the intent of what is in H.R. 1 about speeding up permitting. Mr. Speaker, before I came to Congress, I did engineering work for over two decades. I am a professional engineer, so I worked on a lot of projects where permits were required. Fortunately, we were working with State permitting agencies, and we would hear the same argument from the State permitting agencies: We don't have enough resources and enough people to do these permits. It is going to take longer. A lot of States have programs where they allow the entity trying to attain the permit to pay money to the agency so their employees can work overtime. It is really a way to increase the resources and get more out of the resources. It is not degrading the environmental protections at all. It is just moving the process forward at a faster rate. That is what the intent of H.R. 1 is: to move permitting at a faster clip so we can build all kinds of energy; so we can build solar farms and windmills and high-voltage transmission lines; so we can build pipelines; so we can extract minerals and resources here in America. We can process those and we can manufacture things from them. This is important to making our country a leader in the world by overcoming the position we are in with China on minerals and the position we are in with Russia and OPEC. Mr. Speaker, I support the underlying principle in the bill, and I support the good-governance amendment by my friend from Pennsylvania.",
              "Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer an amendment requiring permitting agencies to determine their technology needs and report them to Congress. Like many of my colleagues across the aisle, I support permitting reforms. We can agree that existing permitting programs are onerous, saddling Americans with rules and regulations that are challenging at best to navigate. Unfortunately, both parties share some of the blame for creating this mess. It is Congress that has spent decades under-resourcing permitting agencies, a big cause of the backlog we are seeing today. Congress' infrastructure investments of the last few years are critical for my district and the entire country. Simply funding projects is not enough, though. That is not the goal of recent legislation. Getting projects built is the goal. Whether it is bridges, broadband, ports, or power lines, making sure that permits are being issued in a consistent and timely manner is key to any project's success. I want to make clear that ensuring predictability is an important piece of the permitting puzzle, one often left out of the discussion. When someone is applying for permits, potential approval or disapproval shouldn't be at the whims of whoever is reviewing their application. Using new technology to improve consistency can help provide the certainty that businesses crave to pursue critical projects in the first place. These reforms can't continue to help big businesses beat out our small businesses. The endless red tape involved in getting permits is a major burden for small businesses. In sector after sector of our economy, market consolidation is squeezing America's small businesses and harming consumers. A business of five employees should be on a level playing field with a business of 5,000 employees when it comes to navigating the permitting system. Ensuring that predictability is one way permitting programs can work better for small businesses. Right now we don't even know what resources permitting agencies need, and that is why the provision in H.R. 1 that agencies assess their staffing needs and report them to Congress is so important. My amendment simply extends that requirement to cover technology, as well. Technology, we all know, is changing so fast right now, and giving permitting agencies better tools can help on so many fronts. New software, including programs using machine learning, can better coordinate simultaneous application reviews by agencies, it can improve agencies' communication with applicants so they can know where their permits are in the process and any additional material that may be needed for certification. New technology can improve predictability and timely review. This is a straightforward measure that would help make the government work the way it ought to. Congress needs to make sure that permitting agencies have the staff, technology, and resources to issue permits and expand permitting capacity. I am proud to offer this amendment to ensure agencies' technology needs are met, and I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

              "I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act. Only a few years ago, our country was comfortably meeting our energy needs with our own production. Under President Biden's reckless energy agenda, however, we have dramatically increased our dependence on foreign oil, sent gas prices sky-high last year, and increased the cost of energy bills for Americans and the people in Indiana who I represent. House Republicans made a commitment to America that we would end the war on American energy, and we are demonstrating that commitment today by passing H.R. 1. This bill will flip the switch on domestic energy production, reversing the administration's anti-energy policies and streamlining our energy infrastructure. Included in this bill is my Securing America's Critical Minerals Supply Act, which would address the broad set of critical energy resources that we need to properly assess our Nation's energy supply, identify critical resources for our economy, and help locate vulnerabilities in our supply chains. Under this legislation, the U.S. could produce energy that is cleaner and safer than other parts of the world--which we already are--where production is tied to dangerous working conditions, child labor exploitation, and extremely low pay. It would also help us shift away from our reliance on energy resources from countries controlled by foreign dictators, better protecting our national security. As a supporter of an all-of-the-above energy approach, I know how crucial it is that we take steps to safeguard and secure the energy resources necessary to keep the lights on, rates down, and emissions low. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 1 so that we can address America's energy crisis created by the administration and meet America's energy needs on our own.",
              "by its position, H.R. 1 reflects a top priority of the House majority. There is much that my constituents in Houston agree we should be prioritizing in this Congress when it comes to energy--not only lowering energy costs, which is the bill's title-- but strengthening our energy security, ensuring and enabling domestic energy production of all kinds, and ensuring our energy future. That comes from serious legislating. That comes from listening. That comes from stakeholders of all kinds coming to the table to grapple with the competing interests here and come up with workable, durable policy. That is, unfortunately, not what we have in this massive bill and not what we are seeing in this Chamber in our debates on energy policy here or across the country. That is a problem. I have warned and will continue to warn that the politicization of energy policy and energy production is one of the most dangerous things that is happening in this country right now, and I am sorry to see that this debate is no different. We simply cannot repeat cursory talking points and epithets that do not get to the complex and urgent challenges in front of us. There are real and dire consequences for our people who produce the energy that we need and use every day and for our environment if we cannot get it together enough to take this work seriously here. We must move from politics to policy. I can't go through all the policy in this bill in the time that I have here. However, I do agree that we must reform the permitting process, that we should continue exports of oil and natural gas, that we need an offshore leasing plan, that we should increase offshore revenue to coastal States, that we need to secure critical minerals, and other ideas contained in this bill. However, H.R. 1 contains so many unworkable provisions that create unrealistic deadlines, threaten our national security, and repeal key environmental and public health protections and programs--including the historic work that we did just in the last Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce methane emissions, incentivize clean energy investment, and protect communities--that I cannot vote for the bill.",
              "I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act. With H.R. 1, we are working to lower energy costs for consumers across America by unleashing American energy and strengthening American supply chains. H.R. 1 addresses regulatory red tape and permitting barriers to the domestic development of energy without compromising environmental protections. The Lower Energy Costs Act also encourages domestic processing and refining of critical energy resources to ensure that components for all energy sources can be made right here in America. As chair of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment, Manufacturing, and Critical Materials, I am proud that H.R. 1 includes seven bills that passed through our subcommittee and full committee through regular order. The bills encourage the domestic refining of critical energy resources, allow for flexible approaches to permitting, support national security, promote innovation that is currently stalled in EPA red tape, repealed two sections of the Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, and protect American refining capacity from agency overreach. I thank Representatives Carter of Georgia, Joyce of Pennsylvania, Pence, Curtis, Pfluger, Palmer, and Crenshaw for their work on this important legislation. In addition, H.R. 1 includes my bill, the Unlocking Our Domestic LNG Energy Potential Act, under section 10007. The section would amend the Natural Gas Act to repeal all restrictions on the import and export of natural gas. Removing such restrictions would help facilitate timely exports of LNG and help our allies. A stronger LNG export industry also means increased domestic production of natural gas and lower domestic prices. I have heard my Democratic colleagues across the aisle criticize H.R. 1 because they say it does nothing for clean energy. This could not be further from the truth. H.R. 1 includes several provisions that incorporate focused flexibilities into certain environmental statutes in order to create an improved regulatory landscape for refining and processing critical minerals. Mr. Speaker, what are the industries that need critical minerals the most? Those are the wind, solar, and battery technology industries--all clean energy technologies. We do almost no critical mineral refining and processing in the United States. That must change, or we risk becoming dangerously dependent on China for our energy and transportation systems. The International Energy Agency estimates that the demand for critical minerals will double by 2040. We want to meet that demand with American resources and reduce reliance on China. I will close by thanking Chair Rodgers for her leadership on the Lower Energy Costs Act. Energy security is national security, and through H.R. 1, we can unleash American energy dominance and lower energy costs for American families, thereby lowering inflation. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the Lower Energy Costs Act."
